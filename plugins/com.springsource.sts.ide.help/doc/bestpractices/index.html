<p>In some cases, you may be unable to comply with a reported Spring best practice. It's also possible that a recommendation isn't appropriate for your particular situation. In such cases, the best practice can be disabled via Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Spring. Select the "STS Bean Validator" and disable any rules that you do not find helpful. </p>
