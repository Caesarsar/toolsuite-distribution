<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: support for multiple launch configurations</p>
<br/>
<p>In the past the boot dashboard listed Spring Boot projects from your workspace and allowed you
to pick a "blessed" launch config to use. This launch config was used when starting/debugging/stopping
the app from the boot dashboard. However there was no way to deal with multiple running instances or
variants of a project. This has changed dramatically in the new version of the Spring Boot dashboard.</p>
<br/>

<p>In the latest incarnation the Spring Boot dashboard directly supports multiple launch configurations
	per project. If you already have multiple launch configs for a project, they automatically show
	up in the boot dashboard as items of the project.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dash-multiple-launches.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p>All the existing features of the boot dashboard are now available for those individual launch configs.
	You can start/debug/stop them, jump to the associated console view, open a browser window for that
	running application, set a default path per launch config (in case you want to have different
	default path settings for your launch configs), tag them, and so on.</p>
<br/>

<p>The project item in the dashboard becomes a shortcut for all those launch configs. It provides you a
	quick summary of the individual launch configs and allows you to execute bulk actions on them, like
	start or stop them all.</p>
<br/>

<p>To reduce clutter and to maintain the simplicity of the UI for the common case where there's just one
	launch configuration per-project, a <em>Hide Solitatry Launch Configurations</em> filter is applied
	to the Dashboard by default, but you can disable this filter if you wish:</p> 
<center><img src="img/boot-dash-filter-solitary-launch-config.png"></img></center>
<br>

<p>This filter hides launch configurations from the tree, unless there is more than one for a given project.
	Disabling the filter will show all Configs:</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dash-show-solitary-conf.png"></img></center><br>

<p>A single configuration is created automatically when an app is launched.  To help you deal with multiple
	launch configs for a project, the context menu got new actions. Those allow you to quickly open a launch
	config editor, to duplicate an existing launch config, or to delete one. And by the way: the duplicate
	action is smart enough to NOT use the same JMX port over and over again, but chooses a new one for each
	launch configs so that they can truly run in parallel.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dash-duplicate-config-action.png"></img></center>
<br>

<p><em>Tip:</em> If you want to run multple instances of a single local app simultaneously (e.g. you want to
	bind multiple local instances of a service via Eureka), you can set the property <code>server.port=0</code>
	to let spring-boot pick a port dynamically (otherwise all but one of your launches will fail because the
	port is already bound).</p>
<br/>

<p>Nevertheless there might be some launch configs in your workspace that you find annoying to show up
	in the boot dashboard. For that case the Spring Boot launch configs got an option to be hidden
	from the boot dashboard. Switch that on and that launch config will never show up in the boot
	dashboard.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-hide-launch-config.png"></img></center>
<br/>


<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: advanced support for Cloud Foundry manifest files</p>
<br/>

<p>Cloud Foundry Manifest files are a nice utility when deploying apps to Cloud Foundry. In the past the
	boot dashboard used a manifest.yml file of the project (if existed) to deploy an app the Cloud Foundry.
	But changes to the running app on Cloud Foundry didn't find its way back into the IDE and deploying
	different variants of the same app to Cloud Foundry was cumbersome. This changes in the new version
	of the Spring Boot dashboard. Cloud Foundry Manifest YAML files are becoming a first-class citizen
	when working with Spring Boot apps in the boot dashboard.</p>
<br/>

<p>The first thing that you will notice is: when you deploy an app in the dashboard to a Cloud Foundry
	section, new dialog opens to let you select the manifest file of your choice:</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-select-manifest-dialog.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p>This allows you to pick a manifest file from your project or anywhere else in the workspace. And the boot
	dashboard remembers your decision. It will use the same manifest file the next time you re-deploy the
	app (for example when deploying and restarting the app with changes you made to the code in your IDE).</p>
<br/>

<p>This explicit support for manifest files also allows you to use various manifest files in your project,
	for example one for each CF instance you would like to to deploy on, an additional one for a specific
	variant of the app, one dev version, etc. You can deploy the same project multiple times to Cloud Foundry
	using different manifest files.</p>
<br/>

<p>In case you don't remember which manifest file you chose for which app or want to change that setting,
	you can use the "Select Manifest" action from the context menu. It will open the same dialog and show
	you which manifest file you chose last time for that application.</p>
<br/>

<p>But what happens if you want to deploy your app without a having to create or keep a manifest file in your
	project? The dialog provides the "manual mode" option for this use case. Switch to the "manual mode"
	and you will be able to edit a temporary manifest file directly within the dialog.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-manifest-manual-mode.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p>The default content of the temporary manifest file will be generated for you, so no need to write everything
	up yourself. But you can change the generated content as well as add additional properties. This gives
	you the option to exactly specify how the project should be deployed to Cloud Foundry.</p>
<br/>

<p>You will also notice that all the nice features for editing Cloud Foundry Manifest files (see below), like
	content-assist, validations, and hover help and available in this dialog, too.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-manifest-manual-mode-editing.png"></img></center>
<br/>
	
<p>By the way: this direct editing of the manifest file content also works if you select an existing manifest
	file. You can quickly change the content of that file directly from within the dialog. No need to close
	the dialog, open the file in an editor, make and save changes, and trigger the deploy action again.
	Just edit the content directly within the dialog. It will save the changes in the file for you.</p>
<br/>

<p>The boot dashboard will use the content of the selected manifest file to deploy the application to
	Cloud Foundry - each time it deployes or updates the app. What happens if you changed the configuration
	of the application on Cloud Foundry in the meantime via the CF CLI or the web console of Cloud Foundry?</p>
<br/>

<p>The Spring Boot Dashboard will check for those changes each time it updates the application on Cloud
	Foundry. If it identifies a difference in the configuration, it will prompt you with a diff and merge
	dialog.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-manifest-diff-merge-dialog.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p>This powerful dialog visualizes the differences that exist between the selected manifest file and the
	configuration of the application on Cloud Foundry. And it allows you to merge those updates into the
	local manifest file with a single click.</p>
<br/>

<p>You can also decide to not merge those changes into your manifest file and use the manifest file as
	it is to deploy the app or to forget the manifest file altogether and continue to use the configuration
	as it exists on Cloud Foundry. In that case, the boot dashboard will remember that decision and don't
	use the manifest file anymore when updating the application.</p>
<br/>

<p>Cloud Foundry Manifest files can contain configuration information for multiple applications in one file.
	Therefore the boot dashboard recognizes this situation and lets you pick the application section from the
	manifest file that you would like to use when deploying the app. The mechanics behind that also support
	multiple applications when showing the diff/merge dialog.</p>
<br/>

<p><b>Known limitation:</b> the "inherit" attribute is not yet fully supported for Cloud Foundry Manifest files. If
	you use the "inherit" attribute, the inherited attributes are not yet taken into account when deploying
	the file nor are they when doing a diff and merge of manifest files and config changes on Cloud Foundry.</p>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: new actions to deploy apps</p>
<br/>
<p>You can now deploy apps directly in run or debug mode via new actions in the context menu. Select the apps
	you want to deploy to a Cloud Foundry instance in the local section of the boot dashboard, go to the context
	menu and take the "Deploy and Run On...". The submenu allows you to directly pick the CF target you would
	like to deploy the app to.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-deploy-actions.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: support for services on Cloud Foundry</p>
<br/>
<p>Cloud Foundry sections in the boot dashboard now visualize service instances with their name
	and selected properties of that service. Double-clicking on that service takes you directly to the
	management web UI of that service (by opening a web browser for the management URL).</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-services.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: improved connect/disconnect/activity handling for Cloud Foundry sections</p>
<br/>
<p>Cloud Foundry sections in the boot dashboard now directly visualize their connected/disconnected status
	and you can manually connect and disconnect those connections to Cloud Foundry. The connected/disconnected
	state will be remembered the next time you start up STS. A disconnected Cloud Foundry section will not
	be connected automatically at next startup. This is particulary useful if you have Cloud Foundry targets
	defined in the boot dashboard that you don't use all the time.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-cf-targets-connected.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p>In addition to that connection problems will be marked as an error on those Cloud Foundry sections, with more
	detailed information showing up when you hover over the section.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-error-indicator.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p>More details about background activity will also be visualized in the Cloud Foundry section, so that you can
	direclty see what is going on when the boot dashboard tries to connect to a Cloud Foundry instance.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-cloud-foundry-activity.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: filter apps by working sets</p>
<br/>
<p>In case you have already organized your projects in your workspace using working sets, you
	can directly filter for those working sets in the boot dashboard. There is no need to add
	additional tags to the apps. Just type in a part of the working set name into the filter box
	and the boot dashboard will show those apps only.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-filter-working-sets.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: visualize request mappings from apps on CF</p>
<br/>

<p>The request mappings property tab now works for apps that are running on CF as well.</p>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: direclty select the default path</p>
<br/>

<p>The boot dashboard allows you to direclty pick the default path for a local app (or an app on Cloud Foundry) in the
	request mappings property tab. Just select the request mapping you would like to use as default for the app and select
	"" from the context menu.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-default-path-action.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Spring Boot Dashboard: host in properties view now a hyperlink</p>
<br/>

<p>The host field on the properties view has turned into a hyperlink that lets you jump to the app
	URL directly from the properties view.</p>
<center><img src="img/boot-dashboard-hyperlink-in-properties.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Advanced Cloud Foundry Manifest Editor</p>
<br/>
<p>STS 3.7.3 adds support for editing <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html">
Cloud Foundry Deployment Manifests</a>. Double clicking a file 
called <code>manifest.yml</code> will automatically open our new <em>Cloud Foundry Manifest Editor</em>.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Tip</em>: If your file has a slightly different name, the dedicated editor won't open automatically on the first double-click. 
So use the <em>Open With</em> context menu to choose it explicitly and STS will remember your choice for future double clicks:</p> 
</p>
<center><img src="img/manifest-yml-open-with.png"></img></center>
<br/>
<p>The editor understands the expected structure and checks the manifest for problems as you type:</p>
<center><img src="img/manifest-yml-reconcile.png"></img></center>
<br/>
<p>The editor provides content assist:</p>
<center><img src="img/manifest-yml-content-assist.png"></img></center>
<br/>
<p>The editor has embedded documentation for all supported properties. This documentation is accessible from the
content assist (see screenshot above) or by hovering over a property with the mouse:</p>
<center><img src="img/manifest-yml-hover.png"></img></center>
<br/>


<p class="nan3">Improvements to the Spring Boot YML and Properties Editors</p>
<br/>
<p>The Yaml Properties editor now checks for duplicate map keys and marks them as errors:</p>

<center><img src="img/application-yml-duplicate-key.png"></img></center><br>

<p>Both the Yaml and Properties Editors now support property deprecation. Deprecated properties are marked as warnings in
each editor:</p>

<center><img src="img/application-yml-deprecated-warning.png"></img></center><br>

<p>Deprecated properties are still suggested by the content assist engine but are clearly marked as deprecated and
are moved to the bottom of the list:</p>

<center><img src="img/application-yml-deprecated-ca.png"></img></center><br>
 
<p>Both the Yaml amd Properties Editor now recognize properties of type <code>java.nio.charset.Charset</code>, 
<code>java.util.Locale</code> and <code>org.springframework.util.MimeType</code> as special cases and provide 
helpful content assist for them:</p>

<center><img src="img/application-props-charset.png"></img></center><br>

<p>Spring Boot 1.3 defines an extension of its <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.3.0.RELEASE/reference/html/configuration-metadata.html">metadata format</a> that allows providing <em>hints</em> to the IDE on how to
provide content assist for specific properties. STS now parses this extended format and provides meaninful content
assist for a subset of it (more complete support to follow in the next release). Wherever we added support, it works 
in both the yml and properties editor. STS 3.7.3 already supports:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Value Hints</b> which allows metadata to suggest a list of possible values for a specific property. For example:</p>

<center><img src="img/application-yml-value-hints.png"></img></center><br>

<p>The <b>logger-name</b> Value Provider which is associated with the Mapping Keys of property <code>logging.level</code> 
in Spring Boot 1.3:</p>

<center><img src="img/application-yml-logger-name.png"></img></center><br>
  
</ul>
<p></p>

<p class="nan3">Improvements to the <em>Edit Starters</em> Wizard</p>
<br>
<p>The <em>Edit Starters</em> wizard is accessible by right-clicking a Maven project's <code>pom.xml</code>, 
from menu <em>Spring >> Edit Starters</em>. This wizard provides a 
way to change the project's dependencies, adding (or removing) starters that you might have forgotten to choose initially 
when creating your project with the <em>New Spring Starter Project</em> Wizard.</p>
<br>

<p>The old implementation only provided an unorganized, long and incomplete list of dependencies. This
has been replaced with a much nicer implementation that completely mirrors the <em>New Spring Starter</em> wizard's 
layout and contents:</p>

<center><img src="img/edit-starters-wizard.png"></img></center><br>

<p>The new implementation provides significant improvements over the old one:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>completeness</b>: All dependencies available from the <em>New Spring Starter</em> wizard are now also available in 
          <em>Edit Starters</em> wizard.
  <li><b>presentation</b>: The dependencies are categorized in the same way as in <em>New Spring Starter</em>, including 
       a <em>Frequently Used</em> category at the top.
  <li><b>searchability</b>: A searchbox allows quickly finding the one dependency that you are interested in.
</ul>

<p class="nan3">SilentExitExceptions ignored by default</p>
<br/>
<p>When running a Spring Boot app in debug mode (while having the Boot Devtools on the classpath), the debugger usually
	stops automatically at a SilentExitException (if you have "stop on uncaught exceptions" enabled). Since this can be
	really annoying, we configure the debugger for Spring Boot apps automatically to ignore exactly that exception.</p>


<p class="nan3">Cloud Foundry Tools</p>
<br/>
 <p>A new milestone version of Cloud Foundry Tools (CFT) 1.0.M3 is included in 3.7.3 and includes many changes that occurred after CFT moved to Eclipse Foundation and
became an Eclipse project. This replaces the old Cloud Foundry Eclipse 1.8.3 tools. If you are downloading a full copy of 3.7.3, CFT is already included.
 </p>
 <br/>
 <p>Further information on the tools can be found at: <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.cft">Cloud Foundry Tools</a></p>
<br/>
<p>Changes in M3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved application running state detection. Starting and Started states of an application are now more accurately reflected in the Servers view</li>
<li>New host taken detection feature in the application deployment wizard. The wizard will now automatically detect if a host is taken and suggest a new host. Alternately, a user can enter a host in the second page of the deployment wizard and manually validate the application URL:</li>
<center><img src="img/cft-host-taken-validation-1.png"></img></center>
<center><img src="img/cft-host-taken-validation-2.png"></img></center>
</ul>

<br/>

<p class="nan3">Gradle BuildShip Integration (Experimental)</p>
<br/>

<p>We encourage users to try out <a href="http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship">BuildShip</a> in preparation 
to eventually making the switch from <em>STS Gradle Tooling</em>. Reading 
this <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/wiki/Migration-guide-from-STS-Gradle-to-Buildship">Migration Guide</a> is 
a good place to start.</p>
<br>
<p>If <em>BuildShip</em> does not yet meet your needs, you can still continue to use <em>STS Gradle Integration</em> for some time to come. 
However, <em>STS Gradle Integration</em>  is in <em>minimal maintenance</em> mode. There will be no more new features and limited bugfixes. 
So please consider filing a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/describecomponents.cgi?product=Buildship">BuildShip Bug Report</a> 
detailing what is stopping you from making the switch.</p>
<br/>
<p>Some known limitations of <em>BuildShip</em> that may affect STS users in particular are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=471728">Bug 471728</a>: <em>BuildShip</em> does not integrate with Eclipse WTP.
While projects that use <code>war</code> packaging can be created using our wizards, such projects are not officialy supported and consequently will
not be correctly configured by <em>BuildShip</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=482315">Bug 482315</a>: Running a <em>BuildShip</em> project with 
<em>Run As Java Application</em> or <em>Run as Spring Boot App</em>, the runtime classpath will be incorrect and contain test dependencies. 
Note: this is not a problem specific only to <em>BuildShip</em>. <em>STS Gradle Integration</em> is also affected as this issue 
stems from a limitation of the Gradle Tooling API that both use.</li>
<li><a href="href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=468244">Bug 468244</a>: BuildShip lacks a mechanism for third-party tooling
providers to participate in configuring a project. STS uses such a mechanism to configure the JDT Annotation Processor when
spring-boot-configration-processor is present on a project's classpath. This automatic configuration currently only works with
<em>STS Gradle Integration</em> but not <em>BuildShip</em>. If you make use of the <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> annotations in 
your code, this means that these annotations will not be processed as part of Eclipse workspace builds unless you manually configure JDT APT.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="nan2">GGTS</a>

<p>Since the end of March Pivotal is no longer sponsoring the Groovy and Grails projects (as described
<a href="http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/groovy-2-4-and-grails-3-0-to-be-last-major-releases-under-pivotal-sponsorship">here</a>).
Therefore we don't ship new versions of the GGTS bundle anymore. Groovy-Eclipse remains on the dashboard
and was fully updated for Eclipse 4.5. It was *not* updated for Eclipse 4.5.1 so beware that if you
install Groovy-Eclipse you will be downgrading your Java compiler and missing all the JDT related fixes that went into 4.5.1.

<h2>Known issues in this release</h2>

<h3>Spring Boot dashboard ngrok tunneling feature doesn't support Spring Cloud Services yet</h3>

<p>The Spring Boot Dashboards ngrok tunnel feature doesn't work yet with remote service registries from Spring Cloud Services.
	  Instead it works with self-deployed Eureka service registry apps on CF only (as described
	  <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/10/15/the-spring-boot-dashboard-in-sts-part-2-working-with-cloud-foundry">here</a>). We
	  are working on enhancing the ngrok tunnel feature to directly support Spring Cloud Services in the near future.</p>

<h3>Conflicting duplicate lifecycle mapping errors in Maven projects upgrading from STS 3.6.x</h3>

<p>Sometimes Maven projects show up with a red error (talking about a duplicate lifecycle mapping conflict) after upgrading STS
	from 3.6.x to the latest 3.7.2 version. In this case, please update the Maven support for Eclipse/STS to the latest version,
	as described here: <a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-4236?focusedCommentId=108387&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-108387">STS-4236</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Error after updating from STS 3.7.0</h3>

<p>Sometimes after updating an existing STS 3.7.0 installation to 3.7.1 an error dialog pops up and STS doesn't start. This
	is a known but not yet solved problem. If you come across this issue, please press "OK" on the dialog and restart STS. It
	will open up fine, including all the updated components.</p>
<br/>

<h3>No repository available when checking for updates</h3>

<p>If you have used a pre-release version of Eclipse Mars or STS, the embedded Eclipse Oomph technology created a cache
of p2 repositores in your home directory. This cached p2 data can cause issues when using STS 3.7.0 or Eclipse Mars. The
error message looks like STS/Eclipse fails to read information from the main Eclipse Mars p2 repository.</p>
<p>In case you encounter this error, please stop Eclipse/STS, go to your home directory, delete "~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.p2",
and restart Eclipse/STS. The related Eclipse bug is: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470912">Bug 470912</a>.</p>

<h3>Live configuration-metadata generation requires Spring Boot 1.2.2</h3>

<p>Spring Boot 1.2.1 configuration processor does not work correctly when executed
from Eclipse's incremental build. This issue is fixed in Spring Boot 1.2.2.
This only affects 'live' metadata generated from your own source code, not the
metadata that is packaged inside spring-boot jars themselves. So you can still 
use older versions of Boot, but the 'live metadata' updates 
will not be accurate. See Spring Boot issue 
<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2313">GH-2313</a>
for details.</p>

<h3>Dashboard and Retina Displays</h3>

<p>When running STS on top of a JDK7, the new dashboard looks a bit blurry when using a HiRes (Retina) display, for example on a Retina MacBook Pro. This is due to the
underlying browser technology that is used to display the dashboard content and that is coming from JavaFX. The JavaFX version that ships with JDK7 doesn't support
retina displays. The solution for this is to run STS on top of a JDK8 build. The JavaFX version that comes with JDK8 supports retina displays.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Dashboard on JDK9</h3>

<p>The JavaFX-based main STS dashboard doesn't work when running STS on top of an early-access version of JDK9. As a workaround run STS on a JDK8 or switch
	the dashboard back to the old (non-JavaFX-based) version via the preferences.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Setting the JDK</h3>

<p>STS requires a JDK to run on top of. Nevertheless the native launcher component might pick up a JRE automatically if you don't specify which
JDK to run STS on top of. To avoid this, you can specify the JDK in the sts.ini file that comes with your STS installation. Add a line at the beginning
"-vm" and an additional line below that which points to the "javaw" executable of the JDK on your machine.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Issues on Linux (GTK3)</h3>

<p>Eclipse 4.5, upon which STS and GGTS are based, is the first Eclipse release where GTK3 is the default for the SWT widget library.
There are some issues with this still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>STS New Dashboard doesn't work under GTK3 because it uses JavaFX which is not currently compatible with GTK3. Instead the old dashboard will
      open.
  <li>The Eclipse editor may be slow to respond (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434898">Eclipse Bug 434898</a>).
</ul>

<p>You may also experience other UI rendering glitches. If you exprience any of these problems you can avoid them by forcing SWT to 
switch back to using GTK2. Just set the environment variable "SWT_GTK3=0" before launching STS or GGTS.
