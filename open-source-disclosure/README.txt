Open Source Disclosure Statement

For libraries that are under a license that require source code disclosure, this directory contains
source code to these libraries. This readme also contains instructions for how to obtain the source
code for libraries that are under open source licenses that require providing information on how to obtain
the source code.


1. The source code of the toolsuite distribution specific files is available from the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/spring-projects/toolsuite-distribution/
Please refer to the tag of the version you have to access the right version of the source code.

2. The source code of the consumed GoPivotal projects is available from their GitHub repositories:
https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-commons/
https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-tcserver/
https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle/
https://github.com/spring-projects/grails-ide/
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/

Please refer to the tag of the version you have to access the right version of the source code.

3. The code of the Eclipse distribution parts of the toolsuite distribution is available from Eclipse.
The main project download pages are located here:
https://www.eclipse.org/indigo
https://www.eclipse.org/juno
https://www.eclipse.org/kepler
https://www.eclipse.org/luna
https://www.eclipse.org/mars

Source code for all those components is available from the Eclipse Git repositories:
https://git.eclipse.org/c/

Please check the project at Eclipse that is responsible for the component you are looking for.
The name of the project usually prefixes the name of the component.

Inside the projects repository please refer to the tag that matches the timestamped version of your component.

4. The source code of additional third-party libraries that are included is available as
part of our archived update site repositories that you can find referenced from our main download page:
https://spring.io/tools3/sts
Take a look at the archived update site links that match the toolsuite and Eclipse version that you are looking for.

5. The linux distributions ship the SWT implementation that comes with Eclipse, but that contains subcomponents
that are licensed under LGPL. The source code for those components is contained in the JAR files in this directory
and also contain the source code of the LGPL subcomponents.
