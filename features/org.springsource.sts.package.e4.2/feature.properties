Logback (LOGBACK)\n\
The plug-in includes software developed by QOS.ch as part of the Logback project.\n\

LOGBACK including its source is available from \n\

\n\
Logback License\n\
\n\
As of release 0.9.18, logback source code and binaries are dual-licensed under the EPL v1.0 and the LGPL 2.1, or more formally:\n\
\n\
Logback: the reliable, generic, fast and flexible logging framework. Copyright (C) 1999-2012, QOS.ch. All rights reserved. This program and the accompanying materials are dual-licensed under either the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 as published by the Eclipse Foundation or (per the licensee's choosing) under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
\n\
The EPL/LGPL dual-license serves several purposes. The LGPL license ensures continuity in terms of licensing of the logback project. Prior to version 0.9.18, logback was licensed (exclusively) under the LGPL v2.1. Moreover, since the EPL is deemed incompatible by the Free Software Foundation, the LGPL will allow various licensees, in particular software distributors who may be already bound by the terms of the GPL or the LGPL, to distribute our software.\n\
\n\
On the other hand, the EPL license will placate organizations which refuse certain restrictions imposed by the LGPL.\n\
\n\
Please note that logback-classic is intended to be used behind the SLF4J API, which is licensed under the MIT license.\n\
\n\
If you wish to make a significant contribution to the logback project, you are invited to file a Contributor License Agreement. The purpose of this agreement is to formalize the terms of your contribution and to protect the project in case of litigation.\n\
\n\
Upon request, we may exempt open-source projects from LGPL and EPL's reciprocity clauses so that the said projects can develop logback extensions under the license of their choice. Exemptions are granted on a case by case basis.\n\

   any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
   4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, \n\
   then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of \n\
   the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those \n\
   notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least \n\

   Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. \n\
   The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do \n\
   not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within \n\
   Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the \n\

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in \n\
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its \n\
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY \n\
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties \n\
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A \n\

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in \n\
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by \n\
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in \n\
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any \n\
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character \n\

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations \n\
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such \n\
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole \n\
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree \n\
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability \n\
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your \n\
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

About EclipseLink 2.3.0\n\
EclipseLink 2.3.0\n\
Eclipse Indigo simultaneous release\n\
Target Date - June 2011\n\
About\n\
The \n\
EclipseLink\n\
 project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services (DBWS).\n\

\n\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\
\n\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n\

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n\
      meet the following conditions:\n\
\n\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\
\n\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n\
          stating that You changed the files; and\n\
\n\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
          the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n\
          as modifying the License.\n\
\n\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
      the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\
\n\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n\

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n\

\n\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n\

\n\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n\
          the Derivative Works; and\n\
\n\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n\

          as modifying the License.\n\
\n\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n\
      the conditions stated in this License.\n\
\n\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
\n\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\
\n\

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n\

\n\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n\

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\

About The  EclipseLink\n\
\n\
project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services (DBWS).\n\

About The  EclipseLink\n\
\n\
project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services (DBWS).\n\

About The  EclipseLink\n\
\n\
project's goal is to provide a complete persistence framework that is both comprehensive and universal. It will run in any Java environment and read and write objects to virtually any type of data source, including relational databases, and XML. EclipseLink will focus on providing leading edge support, including advanced feature extensions, for the dominant persistence standards for each target data source; Java Persistence API (JPA) for relational databases, Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) for XML, Service Data Objects (SDO), and Database Web services (DBWS).\n\

Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b\n\
This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b ("LIBJPEG"). LIBJPEG was used to implement the decoding of JPEG format files in Java (TM). The Content does NOT include any portion of the LIBJPEG file ansi2knr.c.\n\
Your use of LIBJPEG is subject to the terms and conditions located in the \n\
about_files/IJG_README\n\
 file which is included with the Content.\n\
The IJG's website is located at \n\

The following changes were made to the LIBJPEG code in the Content:\n\
In Java, pointer math is not allowed so indexing was used instead.\n\
Function pointers were replaced with switch statements.\n\
The virtual memory, tracing and progress monitoring were removed.\n\
The error handling was simplified and now uses Java exceptions.\n\

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
\n\
1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
i) changes to the Program, and\n\
ii) additions to the Program;\n\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
b) its license agreement:\n\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\

--------------- SECTION 1: Eclipse Public License, V1.0 -----------\n\
\n\
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\n\
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n\
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
\n\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
\n\
        i) changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or\n\
        additions to the Program originate from and are distributed\n\
        by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n\
        from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\n\
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n\
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program\n\
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n\
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\n\
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n\
or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n\
Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n\
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n\
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n\
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n\
    object code form.\n\
\n\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n\
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n\
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n\
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\n\
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n\
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n\
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n\
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\n\
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\n\
    se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n\
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n\
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n\
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n\
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\n\
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n\
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\n\
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\n\
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
    license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\
under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n\
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n\
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n\
        for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n\
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n\
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n\
        party; and\n\
\n\
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\n\
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
        software exchange.\n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n\
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright\n\
    notices contained within the Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n\
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\n\
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\n\
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\n\
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any\n\
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n\
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\n\
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\n\
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n\
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n\
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\n\
claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n\
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement\n\
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\n\
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\n\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\n\
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n\
litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\n\
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\n\
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\n\
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\n\
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement\n\
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve\n\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\n\
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The\n\
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to\n\
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\n\
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect\n\
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new\n\
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,\n\
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\n\
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n\
under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\n\
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\n\
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\n\
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\

indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character\n\
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to\n\
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n\
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised\n\
of the possibility of such damages.\n\
\n\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\n\
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may\n\
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,\n\
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with\n\
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n\
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of\n\
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and\n\
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims\n\
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such\n\
warranty or additional liability.\n\

\n\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n\
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and\n\
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the\n\
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make\n\
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in\n\

\n\
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies\n\
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter\n\
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered\n\
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving\n\
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\
\n\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\
\n\
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\n\
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\n\
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to\n\
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\n\
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only\n\
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n\
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\n\
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n\
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\n\
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor\n\
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\
\n\
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\n\
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\n\
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\n\
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n\
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\n\
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If\n\
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\n\
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n\
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\n\
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n\
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n\
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\
\n\
3.6. Larger Works.\n\
\n\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\n\
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\n\
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\n\
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\
\n\
4. Versions of the License. \n\
\n\
4.1. New Versions.\n\
\n\
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\n\
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\n\
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\n\
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n\
modify this License.\n\
\n\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\n\
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\n\
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\n\
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it\n\
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent\n\
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\n\
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\n\
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\n\
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available\n\
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n\
the license steward.\n\
\n\
4.3. Modified Versions.\n\
\n\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license\n\
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of\n\
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references\n\
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license\n\
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the\n\
license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\

WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF\n\
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE\n\
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n\
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n\
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST\n\
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n\
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY\n\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
6. TERMINATION. \n\
\n\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n\
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions\n\
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of\n\
this License shall survive.\n\
\n\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\n\
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\n\
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is\n\
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software\n\
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor\n\
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)\n\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\n\
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial\n\
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all\n\
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60\n\
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\n\
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such\n\
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n\
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a\n\
written agreement with Participant.\n\
\n\
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\n\
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor\n\
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by\n\
any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\n\
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER\n\
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\n\
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n\
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\n\
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES\n\
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n\
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY\n\
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO\n\
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS\n\
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n\
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
\n\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\n\
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\n\
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and\n\
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in\n\
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n\
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End\n\
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.\n\
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any\n\
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government\n\
rights in computer software under this License.\n\
\n\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\n\
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\n\
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n\
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\n\
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to\n\
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\n\
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to\n\
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located\n\
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within\n\
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,\n\
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\n\
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n\
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any\n\
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall\n\
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n\
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and\n\
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise\n\
make available any Covered Software.\n\
\n\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\
\n\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n\
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out\n\
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work\n\
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility\n\
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to\n\
constitute any admission of liability.\n\

If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n\
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\

--------------SECTION 5: Common Public License, V1.0 ----------------------\n\
\n\
Common Public License Version 1.0\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\n\
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n\
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
\n\
1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n\
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\
\n\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\
\n\
        i) changes to the Program, and\n\
\n\
        ii) additions to the Program;\n\
\n\
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n\
    and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n\
    'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program\n\
    by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n\
    behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n\
    (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction\n\
    with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are\n\
    not derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n\
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n\
combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n\
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n\
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n\
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\n\
    object code form.\n\
\n\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n\
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n\
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n\
    if any, in source code and object code form.  This patent license\n\
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n\
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\n\
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n\
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\n\
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per\n\
    se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n\
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n\
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n\
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n\
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\n\
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\n\
    For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow\n\
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\n\
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
    license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\n\
own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) its license agreement:\n\
\n\
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n\
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n\
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n\
        for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n\
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n\
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n\
        party; and\n\
\n\
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\n\
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
        software exchange.\n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.  \n\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n\
within the Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n\
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n\
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\n\
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\n\
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\n\
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any\n\
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n\
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n\
\n\
    a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such\n\
    claim, and\n\
\n\
    b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n\
    the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n\
    negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\n\
    such claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n\
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\n\
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\n\
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\n\
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate\n\
as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\n\
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\n\
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding\n\
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\n\
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\n\
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\n\
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\n\
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
from time to time.  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right\n\
to modify this Agreement.  IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM\n\
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a\n\
suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given\n\
a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\n\
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under\n\
which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\n\
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including\n\
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in\n\
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses\n\
to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n\
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in\n\
the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\n\
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\n\
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\n\
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\

      limitation Section 2.2.  The Source Code version of Covered Code\n\
      may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future\n\
      version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must\n\
      include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code\n\
      You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source\n\
      Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\n\
      this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You\n\
      may include an additional document offering the additional rights\n\
      described in Section 3.5.\n\
\n\
   3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\
\n\
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\n\
      be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this\n\
      License either on the same media as an Executable version or via\n\
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n\
      you made an Executable version available; and if made available\n\
      via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\n\
      at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n\
      available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version\n\
      of that particular Modification has been made available to such\n\
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\n\
      version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\n\
      Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\
\n\
   3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\
\n\
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain\n\
      a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\n\
      Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n\
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,\n\
      from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including\n\
      the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)\n\
      in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation\n\
      in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\
\n\
   3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\
\n\
      (a) Third Party Claims.\n\
\n\
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n\
          party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n\
          the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\n\
          2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n\
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\n\
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient\n\
          will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge\n\
          after the Modification is made available as described in Section\n\
          3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all\n\
          copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take\n\
          other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or\n\
          newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received\n\
          the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\
\n\
      (b) Contributor APIs.\n\
\n\
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n\
          programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\n\
          licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that\n\
          API, Contributor must also include this information in the\n\
          LEGAL file.\n\
\n\
      (c)   Representations.\n\
\n\
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n\
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n\
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n\
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\n\
          by this License.\n\
\n\
   3.5. Required Notices.\n\
\n\
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n\
      Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a\n\
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\n\
      include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n\
      where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\n\
      created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\n\
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\n\
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\n\
      where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\n\
      to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\n\
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or\n\
      more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on\n\
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or\n\
      any Contributor.\n\
\n\
      You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,\n\
      indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\n\
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n\
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\n\
      or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity\n\
      or liability terms You offer.\n\
\n\
   3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\
\n\
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n\
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n\
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version\n\
      of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n\
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n\
      obligations of Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously\n\
      included in any notice in an Executable version, related\n\
      documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\n\
      rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the\n\
      Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a\n\
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from\n\
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\n\
      of this License and that the license for the Executable version\n\
      does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the\n\
      Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.\n\
      If You distribute the Executable version under a different license\n\
      You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n\
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n\
      Developer or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the\n\
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n\
      by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any\n\
      such terms You offer.\n\
\n\
   3.7. Larger Works.\n\
\n\
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n\
      code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n\
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\n\
      the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\
\n\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\
\n\
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n\
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,\n\
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms\n\
   of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n\
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included\n\
   in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with\n\
   all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n\
   by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n\
   detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\
\n\
5. Application of this License.\n\
\n\
   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n\
   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\
\n\
6. Versions of the License.\n\
\n\
   6.1. New Versions.\n\
\n\
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish\n\
      revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\n\
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\
\n\
   6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\
\n\
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n\
      the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n\
      that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n\
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n\
      Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the\n\
      terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\
\n\
   6.3. Derivative Works.\n\
\n\
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which\n\
      you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n\
      Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\n\
      license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",\n\
      "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase\n\
      do not appear in your license (except to note that your license\n\
      differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n\
      Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n\
      Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in\n\
      the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor\n\
      in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be\n\
      deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\
\n\
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
\n\
   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"\n\
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n\
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE\n\
   IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n\
   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n\
   OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n\
   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\n\
   CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\n\
   CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n\
   OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER\n\
   EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
8. TERMINATION.\n\
\n\
   8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n\
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n\
      cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n\
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n\
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by\n\
      their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\n\
      License shall survive.\n\
\n\
   8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\n\
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\n\
      a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n\
      file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\n\
\n\
      (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n\
          infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by\n\
          such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\n\
          License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\n\
          prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\n\
          notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant\n\
          a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and\n\
          future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)\n\
          withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor\n\
          Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice,\n\
          a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\n\
          agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n\
          is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You\n\
          under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the\n\
          expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\
\n\
      (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n\
          Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any\n\
          patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant\n\
          under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of\n\
          the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,\n\
          Modifications made by that Participant.\n\
\n\
   8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n\
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly\n\
      or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved\n\
      (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\n\
      patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the\n\
      licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2\n\
      shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of\n\
      any payment or license.\n\
\n\
   8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all\n\
      end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n\
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n\
      prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\
\n\
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n\
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n\
   DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n\
   OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n\
   ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n\
   CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n\
   WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n\
   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n\
   INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF\n\
   LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n\
   RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE\n\
   LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n\
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,\n\
   SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\
\n\
   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\n\
   in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\n\
   software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as\n\
   such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n\
   with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n\
   (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with\n\
   only those rights set forth herein.\n\
\n\
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n\
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n\
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n\
   necessary to make it enforceable.\n\
\n\
   This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to\n\
   the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its\n\
   conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least\n\
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do\n\
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to\n\
   this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts\n\
   of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa\n\
   Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,\n\
   including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\n\
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n\
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n\
   Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n\
   shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\
\n\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\
\n\
   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n\
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n\
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree\n\
   to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n\
   responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or\n\
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\
\n\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\
\n\
   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code\n\
   as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial\n\
   Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n\
   Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n\
   by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\

---------- SECTOPM 7: GNU Lesser General Public License, V2.1 --------------\n\
\n\
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
		       Version 2.1, February 1999\n\
\n\
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\
\n\
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\n\
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n\
 the version number 2.1.]\n\
\n\
			    Preamble\n\
\n\
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n\
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n\
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n\
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\
\n\
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n\
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n\
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n\
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n\
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n\
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\
\n\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n\
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n\
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n\
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n\
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n\
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n\
these things.\n\
\n\
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n\
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n\
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n\
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\
\n\
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n\
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n\
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n\
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n\
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n\
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n\
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\
\n\
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n\
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n\
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\
\n\
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n\
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n\
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n\
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n\
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n\
introduced by others.\n\
\n\
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n\
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n\
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n\
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n\
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n\
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\
\n\
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n\
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n\
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n\
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n\
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n\
libraries into non-free programs.\n\
\n\
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n\
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n\
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n\
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n\
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n\
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n\
the library.\n\
\n\
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\n\
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n\
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n\
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n\
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n\
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n\
special circumstances.\n\
\n\
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n\
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n\
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n\
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n\
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n\
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n\
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\
\n\
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n\
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n\
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n\
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n\
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n\
system.\n\
\n\
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n\
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n\
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n\
that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
\n\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\n\
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n\
be combined with the library in order to run.\n\
\n\
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
\n\
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n\
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n\
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n\
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\n\
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\n\
\n\
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n\
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n\
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\
\n\
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\n\
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\n\
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n\
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n\
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n\
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n\
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\n\
\n\
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n\
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n\
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n\
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n\
and installation of the library.\n\
\n\
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n\
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n\
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n\
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n\
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n\
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n\
and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\
\n\
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n\
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n\
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n\
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n\
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n\
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n\
Library.\n\
\n\
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n\
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n\
fee.\n\
\n\
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n\
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n\
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n\
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
\n\
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\
\n\
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n\
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\
\n\
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n\
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\
\n\
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n\
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n\
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n\
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n\
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n\
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n\
    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\
\n\
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n\
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n\
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n\
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n\
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n\
    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\
\n\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n\
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n\
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n\
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n\
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n\
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n\
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n\
it.\n\
\n\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n\
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n\
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n\
collective works based on the Library.\n\
\n\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n\
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n\
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n\
the scope of this License.\n\
\n\
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n\
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n\
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n\
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n\
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n\
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n\
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n\
these notices.\n\
\n\
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n\
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n\
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\
\n\
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n\
the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\
\n\
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n\
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n\
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n\
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n\
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n\
medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\
\n\
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n\
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n\
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n\
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n\
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\
\n\
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n\
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n\
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\n\
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n\
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\
\n\
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\n\
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n\
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\n\
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n\
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\
\n\
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\n\
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n\
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n\
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n\
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n\
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\
\n\
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n\
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n\
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n\
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n\
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n\
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\
\n\
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n\
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n\
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n\
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\
\n\
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n\
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\n\
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n\
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n\
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n\
engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
\n\
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n\
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n\
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n\
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n\
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n\
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n\
of these things:\n\
\n\
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n\
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n\
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n\
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n\
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\n\
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n\
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n\
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n\
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n\
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n\
    to use the modified definitions.)\n\
\n\
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n\
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n\
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n\
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n\
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n\
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n\
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\
\n\
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n\
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n\
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n\
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\
\n\
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n\
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n\
    specified materials from the same place.\n\
\n\
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n\
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\
\n\
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\n\
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n\
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n\
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n\
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n\
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n\
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n\
the executable.\n\
\n\
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n\
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n\
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n\
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n\
distribute.\n\
\n\
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n\
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n\
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n\
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n\
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n\
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\
\n\
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n\
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n\
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n\
    Sections above.\n\
\n\
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n\
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n\
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\
\n\
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n\
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n\
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n\
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n\
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n\
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n\
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\
\n\
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n\
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n\
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n\
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n\
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n\
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n\
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n\
the Library or works based on it.\n\
\n\
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n\
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n\
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n\
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n\
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n\
this License.\n\
\n\
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n\
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n\
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n\
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n\
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n\
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n\
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n\
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n\
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\
\n\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n\
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n\
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\
\n\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n\
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n\
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n\
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n\
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n\
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n\
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n\
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n\
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n\
impose that choice.\n\
\n\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n\
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
\n\
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n\
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n\
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n\
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n\
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n\
written in the body of this License.\n\
\n\
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n\
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n\
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n\
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
\n\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n\
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\n\
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n\
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n\
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n\
the Free Software Foundation.\n\
\n\
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n\
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n\
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n\
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n\
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n\
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n\
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n\
and reuse of software generally.\n\
\n\
			    NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n\
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n\
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n\
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n\
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n\
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n\
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\
\n\
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n\
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n\
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n\
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n\
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n\
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n\
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n\
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n\
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n\
DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\
\n\
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\
\n\
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n\
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n\
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n\
ordinary General Public License).\n\
\n\
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n\
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n\
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\
\n\
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\
\n\
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n\
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n\
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n\
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\
\n\
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n\
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\
\n\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n\
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n\
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\
\n\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\
\n\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n\
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\n\
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\
\n\
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n\
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\
\n\

That's all there is to it!\n\

-----SECTION 8: IBM Public License, V1.0 --------------------------------\n\
\n\
IBM Public License Version 1.0\n\
\n\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM\n\
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\
1. DEFINITIONS\n\
\n\
"Contribution" means:\n\
\n\
   1. in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"),\n\
      the Original Program, and\n\
\n\
   2. in the case of each Contributor,\n\
\n\
         1. changes to the Program, and\n\
         2. additions to the Program; \n\
\n\
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n\
      and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n\
      'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program\n\
      by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\n\
      behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n\
      (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction\n\
      with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)\n\
      are not derivative works of the Program.\n\
\n\
"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\n\
\n\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n\
or when combined with the Program.\n\
\n\
"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying\n\
this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code\n\
and documentation, if any.\n\
\n\
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.\n\
\n\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n\
including all Contributors.\n\
\n\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\
\n\
   1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n\
      license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n\
      publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of\n\
      such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source\n\
      code and object code form.\n\
\n\
   2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n\
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n\
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n\
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n\
      if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license\n\
      shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program\n\
      if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,\n\
      such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\n\
      covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not\n\
      apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No\n\
      hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\
\n\
   3. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n\
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n\
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n\
      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n\
      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n\
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n\
      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n\
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n\
      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n\
      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent\n\
      license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,\n\
      it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before\n\
      distributing the Program.\n\
\n\
   4. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n\
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n\
      license set forth in this Agreement.\n\
\n\
3. REQUIREMENTS\n\
\n\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\n\
under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\
\n\
   1. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\
   2. its license agreement:\n\
\n\
      1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all\n\
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n\
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n\
         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n\
         for a particular purpose;\n\
\n\
      2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n\
         for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental\n\
         and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\
\n\
      3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n\
         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\
\n\
      4. states that source code for the Program is available from\n\
         such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n\
         reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n\
         software exchange.\n\
\n\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\
\n\
   1. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\
\n\
   2. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\n\
      Program.\n\
\n\
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\n\
\n\
    Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation\n\
    and others. All Rights Reserved.\n\
\n\
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of\n\
its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n\
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\
\n\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\n\
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\n\
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\n\
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a\n\
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")\n\
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor\n\
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\n\
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\n\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\n\
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor\n\
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering.  The obligations in this section do not apply to any\n\
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n\
infringement.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n\
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\n\
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\n\
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n\
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\n\
claim at its own expense.\n\
\n\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,\n\
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\n\
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under\n\
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims\n\
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and\n\
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any\n\
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\
\n\
5. NO WARRANTY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\n\
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n\
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\n\
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\n\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining\n\
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\n\
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or\n\
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\
\n\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\
\n\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\n\
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n\
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n\
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION\n\
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\
\n\
7. GENERAL\n\
\n\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n\
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n\
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\
\n\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\n\
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\n\
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\n\
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate\n\
as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient\n\
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim\n\
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding\n\
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\n\
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\n\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\
\n\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\n\
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\n\
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\n\
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\n\
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\n\
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.  However, Recipient's\n\
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\n\
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\
\n\
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\n\
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\n\
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)\n\
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\n\
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n\
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n\
(including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than\n\
IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in\n\
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses\n\
to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n\
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in\n\
the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\
\n\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\n\
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than\n\
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights\n\
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\
