			Currently the dm Server Tools support direct deployment of WTP Dynamic Web Projects, OSGi
			bundle and PAR projects to the dm Server from directly within Eclipse.
		</p><p>
			To deploy an application to the SpringSource dm Server just bring up the context menu on the configured
			SpringSource dm Server runtime in the Servers view and choose "Add or Remove Projects...". In the
			dialog, select the desired project and add it to the list of "Configured projects".

				Deploying and undeploying an application from the dm Server certainly works
				while the SpringSource dm Server is running, but you can also add or remove projects if the dm Server
				is not running.
			</p></td></tr></table></div><p>
			Once an application is deployed on the SpringSource dm Server the tooling support will automatically 
			pick up any change to source files -- for example, Java and XML context files -- and refresh the
			deployed application on the Server.
		</p><p>
			The wait time between a change and the actual refresh can be configured
			in the configuration editor of the runtime. To bring up that editor,
			double-click on the configured SpringSource dm Server instance in the Servers view.
