<h1 class="nan1">Spring Tool Suite 3.9.0: New and Noteworthy</h1>

<p class="nan3">General introduction video to the Spring Tool Suite</p>

<p>
	Josh Long published a nice Spring Tips video, introducing the Spring Tool Suite.</p>
</br>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mtI4vmsQ08?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>
	This video doesn't feature all the latest enhancements and changes from this 3.9.0 release, but provides a great
	introduction to the Spring Tool Suite in general.</p>

<p class="nan2">Updates and New/Enhanced Features</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Oxygen (4.7)</p>
<p>The default STS distribution is now based on the recently released Eclipse Oxygen (4.7) release. <a href="">Highlights from the Oxygen can be found here.</a></p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.2.6</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.2.6 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">New option to improve Spring Boot app startup speed</p>
<p>...</p>

<p class="nan3">Updates to the Cloud Foundry Manifest editing support</p>
<p>new dynamic value support for domains + hosts + stacks + services + routes, improved route support, support for new health-check attributes</p>
<p>
	The underlying mechanics of the Cloud Foundry manifest editing support have changed in this release. Most of the features
	are now realized as part of a so-called language server that runs as a separate process. So don't be surprised to see another process
	running on your machine whenever you have a CF manifest file open to edit.</p>
<p>
	In case you updated an existing STS installation to this new version of the Spring Tool Suite, you didn't get the language server
	based support automatically. You would need to manually install the language server via "Install New Software", type in <a href="http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/sts4-language-servers/">http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/sts4-language-servers/</a>
	and select the Cloud Foundry Manifest Editor Language Server feature. After that installed and you restarted STS, you will get
	all the new features.</p>
<p>
	In case something goes wrong and you would like to switch this feature off, you can go to the About dialog, select the Installation Details
	and uninstall the feature "Cloud Foundry Manifest Editing Language Server".</p>

<p class="nan3">Improvements to the Spring Cloud CLI integration</p>
<p>automatic download/install, preference to install, log streaming to console, reduced number of JVMs, works with Sprign Cloud 1.3.x</p>

<p class="nan3">Important Changes and Fixes</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>various minor UI improvements to the "New Spring Starter" wizard</li>
<li>@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping now supported in request mapping overviews</li>
<li>early work to support running on top of JDK9</li>
</ul>

<p class="nan2">Important Notes</p>

<p class="nan3">Issues now tracked on GitHub Issues</p>

<p>Issues around the Spring Tool Suite and the Spring IDE are tracked on GitHub from now on:
	<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues</a>.</p>

<p class="nan3">Thanks for using the automatic error reporting</p>

<p>We would also like to thank our users for using the automated error reporting that we included since the 3.8.2 release and for
	sending us all those error reports. We used them to fix issues and improve reliability in this
	release. And we will continue to do that. So please keep those error reports coming!</p>

<p class="nan3">macOS Sierra causes lost settings and lost add-on installs</p>

<p>If you unpackage the STS archive on macOS Sierra and use it without moving it to a different location on your
	drive, macOS Sierra Gatekeeper activates a security feature called "Path Randomization" for the app. This causes
	the STS.app bundle to be copied to a private and randomized read-only folder on your disc every time you start
	STS after a restart of your machine. As a result, all your third-party installs are lost as well as your global
	configuration. As a workaround, please move the STS.app bundle to a different location on your drive before
	starting it.</p>

<p class="nan3">Manual Maven support going to be removed soon</p>

<p>We plan to remove the support for manual Maven projects from STS and Spring IDE in future versions of STS and
	Spring IDE. The manual maven support was used in the past when projects used Maven, but didn't opt-in to use
	the direct Maven support in Eclipse via the m2e project. While projects can still decide to not use m2e for their
	projects, the support for that via additional menu actions in STS will be gone.</p>

<h2>Known issues in this release</h2>

<h3>Running on JDK9</h3>

<p>Using a few options, it is possible to run and use the Spring Tool Suite on top of a JDK9. However, please notice that
	the Maven support in Eclipse/STS runs within the JVM of the IDE and therefore also uses the JDK9 runtime. While that isn't
	necessarily a problem, having Maven modules in your build that aren't compatible with Java9 might cause your project
	build to fail in Eclipse/STS.</p>
<p>
	This is the case, for example, if you use Spring Boot 1.5.x or earlier versions, which uses an older version of the
	Maven jar plugin, which fails when running on top of a Java9 VM. In that case we recommend to configure Eclipse/STS
	to run on top of a Java8 runtime (by modifying the eclipse.ini or sts.ini file accordingyly).</p>
<br/>
		
<h3>macOS Sierra might cause loss of settings and installed plugins</h3>

<p>If you unpackage the STS archive on macOS Sierra and use it without moving it to a different location on your
	drive, macOS Sierra Gatekeeper activates a security feature called "Path Randomization" for the app. This causes
	the STS.app bundle to be copied to a private and randomized read-only folder on your disc every time you start
	STS after a restart of your machine. As a result, all your third-party installs are lost as well as your global
	configuration. As a workaround, please move the STS.app bundle to a different location on your drive before
	starting it.</p>
	<p>The corresponding issue in the STS issue tracker:
		<a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-4406">STS-4406: STS 3.8.2 and MacOS Sierra</a></p>

<h3>Spring Boot dashboard ngrok tunneling feature doesn't support Spring Cloud Services yet</h3>

<p>The Spring Boot Dashboards ngrok tunnel feature doesn't work yet with remote service registries from Spring Cloud Services.
	  Instead it works with self-deployed Eureka service registry apps on CF only (as described
	  <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/10/15/the-spring-boot-dashboard-in-sts-part-2-working-with-cloud-foundry">here</a>). We
	  are working on enhancing the ngrok tunnel feature to directly support Spring Cloud Services in the near future. In the meantime
	  we published a tech note that describes <a href="http://static.springsource.org/sts/nan/v373/SpringToolSuite-LocalServicesAndSCS.html">
      how to setup ngrok tunneling in combination with SCS manually</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Conflicting duplicate lifecycle mapping errors in Maven projects upgrading from STS 3.6.x</h3>

<p>Sometimes Maven projects show up with a red error (talking about a duplicate lifecycle mapping conflict) after upgrading STS
	from 3.6.x to the latest 3.7.2 version. In this case, please update the Maven support for Eclipse/STS to the latest version,
	as described here: <a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-4236?focusedCommentId=108387&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-108387">STS-4236</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Error after updating from STS 3.7.0</h3>

<p>Sometimes after updating an existing STS 3.7.0 installation to 3.7.1 an error dialog pops up and STS doesn't start. This
	is a known but not yet solved problem. If you come across this issue, please press "OK" on the dialog and restart STS. It
	will open up fine, including all the updated components.</p>
<br/>

<h3>No repository available when checking for updates</h3>

<p>If you have used a pre-release version of Eclipse Mars or STS, the embedded Eclipse Oomph technology created a cache
of p2 repositores in your home directory. This cached p2 data can cause issues when using STS 3.7.0 or Eclipse Mars. The
error message looks like STS/Eclipse fails to read information from the main Eclipse Mars p2 repository.</p>
<p>In case you encounter this error, please stop Eclipse/STS, go to your home directory, delete "~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.p2",
and restart Eclipse/STS. The related Eclipse bug is: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470912">Bug 470912</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Live configuration-metadata generation requires Spring Boot 1.2.2</h3>

<p>Spring Boot 1.2.1 configuration processor does not work correctly when executed
from Eclipse's incremental build. This issue is fixed in Spring Boot 1.2.2.
This only affects 'live' metadata generated from your own source code, not the
metadata that is packaged inside spring-boot jars themselves. So you can still 
use older versions of Boot, but the 'live metadata' updates 
will not be accurate. See Spring Boot issue 
<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2313">GH-2313</a>
for details.</p>
<br>

<h3>Dashboard and Retina Displays</h3>

<p>When running STS on top of a JDK7, the new dashboard looks a bit blurry when using a HiRes (Retina) display, for example on a Retina MacBook Pro. This is due to the
underlying browser technology that is used to display the dashboard content and that is coming from JavaFX. The JavaFX version that ships with JDK7 doesn't support
retina displays. The solution for this is to run STS on top of a JDK8 build. The JavaFX version that comes with JDK8 supports retina displays.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Silent loss of Functionality on Java 7 or earlier</h3>

<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run on top of. If you are running it with an older JDK this may not be immediatlely apparant, but some of 
STS functionality will simply be 'absent' because the corresponding plugins are automatically disabled by OSGI because their requirements
are not satisfied at runtime. See also below 'Setting the JDK'.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Setting the JDK</h3>

<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run on top of. Nevertheless the native Eclipse launcher component might pick up a JRE or an older JDK automatically 
if you don't specify which JDK to run STS on top of. To avoid this, you can specify the JDK in the sts.ini file that comes with your STS installation. 
Add a line at the beginning "-vm" and an additional line below that which points to the "javaw" executable of the JDK on your machine.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Issues on Linux (GTK3)</h3>

<p>Eclipse 4.5, upon which STS and GGTS are based, is the first Eclipse release where GTK3 is the default for the SWT widget library.
There are some issues with this still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>STS New Dashboard doesn't work under GTK3 because it uses JavaFX which is not currently compatible with GTK3. Instead the old dashboard will
      open.
  <li>The Eclipse editor may be slow to respond (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434898">Eclipse Bug 434898</a>).
</ul>

<p>You may also experience other UI rendering glitches. If you exprience any of these problems you can avoid them by forcing SWT to 
switch back to using GTK2. Just set the environment variable "SWT_GTK3=0" before launching STS or GGTS.
