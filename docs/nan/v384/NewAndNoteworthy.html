<h1 class="nan1">Spring Tool Suite 3.8.4 - 3.8.0: New and Noteworthy</h1>

<p>
	Josh Long published a nice Spring Tips video, introducing the Spring Tool Suite.</p>
</br>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mtI4vmsQ08?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>We would also like to thank our users for using the automated error reporting that we included since the 3.8.2 release and for
	sending us all those error reports. We used them to fix issues and improve reliability in this
	release. And we will continue to do that. So please keep those error reports coming!</p>

<p class="nan3">Issues now tracked on GitHub Issues</p>

<p>Issues around the Spring Tool Suite and the Spring IDE are tracked on GitHub from now on:
	<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues</a>.</p>
<br/>

<p class="nan2">Updates and New/Enhanced Features in 3.8.4</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Neon.3 (4.6.3)</p>
<p>The default STS distribution is now based on the recently released Eclipse Neon.3 (4.6.3) release.</p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.2.4.SR1</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.2.4.SR1 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">Early Access for Eclipse Oxygen 4.7 available</p>
<p>Since STS 3.8.4 we have early-access versions available for the latest Eclipse Oxygen 4.7 builds. You can
	find the update site here:</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.7">http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.7</a>
</p>
<p><b>Attention:</b> Eclipse Oxygen M6 has a severe bug that prevents the JEE, Java, and STS packages to work properly. If you want
	to install STS into Eclipse 4.7, you need to make sure use post-M6 builds of Eclipse Oxygen as a base.</p>
<p>
	You can also download complete STS distribution packages based on early Eclipse 4.7 versions from our nightly downloads page at: <a href ="http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/STS/nightly-distributions.html"></a>
</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Data Tools removed</p>
<p>Due to various users reporting issues related to the Eclipse Data Tools that we included in STS, we decided to remove
	those features from the default STS distribution. We added an item to the dashboard extension install listing
	that makes it easy for you to get them back into your STS in case you would like to use them.</p>

<p class="nan3">Buildship 2.0 import strategy for Getting Started Wizards</p>

<p>The "New Spring Starter Project" and "Import Getting Started Content" now provide a "Buildship 2.x"
import strategy. For backwards compatibility the old import startegy which supports "Buildship 1.x" is
also still available.</p>

<p class="nan3">Revamped UI for the "New Spring Starter" and "Edit Starters" Wizards</p>

TODO: Fill in the details and add some screenshos (here are some potential highlights):
<ul>
  <li> Use a custom initializr service</li>
  <li> Buildship 2.x Import Strategy added. Buildship 1.x can also still be used with the old strategy.
  <li> more intuitive two-colum layout</li>
  <li>
  	Initial project name is unique with respect to names of projects in the workspace.
  	Changes to project name are laso reflected on the default artifact name.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Links to relevant documentation accessible on mouse-hovers with HTML content.
  	<center><img src="screenshot/starter-wizard-hover.png"></img></center>
  </li>
  <li> Content-assist "Shortcut" to open "Edit Starters" dialog from the pom editor</li>
</ul>

<p class="nan3">Spring Cloud CLI Integration: Local Services in the Boot Dash</p>
<p>
Spring Cloud CLI available services are shown in the Boot Dashboard under <b>local</b>
run target below the Spring Boot project entries. The Boot Dashboard provides the expected life cycle management
control features over Cloud services provided by Spring Cloud CLI such as starting and stopping a service. In order
to see these services in the Boot Dashboard one would need to point STS to a Spring Boot CLI installation <u>with 
Spring Cloud CLI installed in it</u> via preferences <b>Spring->Boot->CLI</b>. Current limitation is STS integration 
not aware of any Spring Cloud CLI services started manually via CLI.

</p>

<p class="nan3">Cloudfoundry Support</p>

<p>Support was added for the new "routes" property, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Content assist and basic validation in the manifest editor</li>
  <li>
  	Basic validation in the manifest editor detects if legacy <code>domain(s)</code>, <code>host(s)</code> or 
  	<code>no-hostname</code> were used with the new <code>routes</code> property in the same manifest and report errors 
  	appropriately.
  	<center><img src="screenshot/cf-manifest-reconcile.png"></img></center>
  </li>
  <li>
  	Deployment manifest compare and merge support for <code>routes</code> property is available

<p class="nan2">Important Notes for 3.8.4</p>

<p class="nan3">macOS Sierra causes lost settings and lost add-on installs</p>

<p>If you unpackage the STS archive on macOS Sierra and use it without moving it to a different location on your
	drive, macOS Sierra Gatekeeper activates a security feature called "Path Randomization" for the app. This causes
	the STS.app bundle to be copied to a private and randomized read-only folder on your disc every time you start
	STS after a restart of your machine. As a result, all your third-party installs are lost as well as your global
	configuration. As a workaround, please move the STS.app bundle to a different location on your drive before
	starting it.</p>

<p class="nan3">Manual Maven support going to be removed soon</p>

<p>We plan to remove the support for manual Maven projects from STS and Spring IDE in future versions of STS and
	Spring IDE. The manual maven support was used in the past when projects used Maven, but didn't opt-in to use
	the direct Maven support in Eclipse via the m2e project. While projects can still decide to not use m2e for their
	projects, the support for that via additional menu actions in STS will be gone.</p>
<br/>


<hr/>


<p class="nan2">Updates and Fixes in 3.8.3</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Neon.2 (4.6.2)</p>
<p>The default STS distribution is now based on the recently released Eclipse Neon.2 (4.6.2) release.</p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.2.2</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.2.2 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">Important Changes and Fixes</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Support for Legacy Maven project conversion removed (used to convert m2eclipse projects to use m2e)</li>
<li>Added support for one-time passcode for Cloud Foundry targets in the Spring Boot Dashboard</li>
<li>Added support for WAR packaging of Spring Boot apps when deploying them to CF in the Spring Boot Dashboard</li>
<li>Addes support for health-check in Cloud Foundry manifest files</li>
<li>Added a link to the tc-server documentation about templates in the new instance wizard</li>
<li>Fixed a number of most-reported errors from the automated error reporting</li>
</ul>

<p class="nan2">Updates and Fixes in 3.8.2</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Neon.1 (4.6.1)</p>
<p>The default STS distribution is now based on the recently released Eclipse Neon.1 (4.6.1) release. There is a nice
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0ENpGcP34">4min video on YouTube about noticable updates and improvements
	in Neon.1</a>, alongside various bug fixes that went into this release.</p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.2.0</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.2.0 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">Automatic Error Reporting now included</p>
<p>The Spring Tool Suite now comes with automatic error reporting being included in the distribution. This allows you to
	report errors that happen under the hood of the IDE automatically to the development team.</p>
<p>This automatic error reporting mechanism is an opt-in mechanism that uses the same automatic error reporting infrastructure
	that the regular Eclipse Neon packages include. You can configure all the details via the preferences:</p>

<center><img src="screenshot/aer-preferences.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p>More details about the underlying technology, the exact information that is being transfered, where it is being
stored, etc, can be found here: <a href="http://docs.spring.io/sts/nan/v382/SpringToolSuite-AERI-Details.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<p class="nan3"><a name="bootdash"></a><a name="targetlabels"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: OAuth Token support</p>
<p>In case you use the nice integration of Cloud Foundry into the boot dashboard, you are now able to select the way the boot
	dashboard should remember your CF credentials. You can choose to not store the credentials at all, store them in the
	secure storage facility that is provided by Eclipse, or (and this option is new) to use an oauth token (which is stored
	by the boot dashboard in a local file).</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/dashboard-oauth-token.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="bootdash"></a><a name="targetlabels"></a>Buildpack content assist now provides additional hints</p>
<p>The content assist for Cloud Foundry manifest files provides nice content-assist for various property values. For the
	buildpack option those content-assist values are dynamically inferred from the configured Cloud Foundry targets in your
	boot dashboard.</p>
<p>While this is easy and convenient while using a single Cloud Foundry target, it can be confusing if you use various
	Cloud Foundry targets from different CF installations, since those can each provide a different set of available
	buildpacks.</p>
<p>To avoid this confusion, the boot dashboard now shows additional information if a buildpack is available only on a
	certain set of Cloud Foundry targets.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/manifest-editor-buildpack-cf-target-info.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="bootdash"></a><a name="targetlabels"></a>Custom URLs for Spring Initializr</p>
<p>It is now possible to specify the URL of the <b>Spring Initializr</b> instance that the <b>Spring Starter Project</b> wizard should use via
	the preference settings at Spring -> Boot -> Initializr. This is extremely useful if you use your own, customized version
	of the Spring Initializr app in-house and would like to use that directly in STS.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/custom-initializr-url.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="bootdash"></a><a name="targetlabels"></a>Spring Starter Wizard now allows default selections</p>
<p>Spring Starter Wizard has two new buttons:
<ul>
<li>`Make Default` - allows you to preset selected by default starter project dependencies for the next time the wizard is opened.</li>
<li>`Clear Selection` - clears currently selected starter project dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/initializr-wizard-new-buttons.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Important Changes and Fixes</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard: fixed a problem with retrieving request mappings when skip-ssl-verification was active</li>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard: fixed a problem with certain request mappings confused the dashboard</li>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard: fixed a problem that confused the dashboard when deleting launch configs of running boot apps</li>
<li>New Spring Starter Wizard: improved UI behavior when typing into search field</li>
<li>added an m2e connector for the Spring Boot maven plugin</li>
<li>New Spring Starter Wizard: fixed a deadlock when selecting Buildship</li>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard: fixed problems when pushing multiple apps to CF in parallel</li>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard: doesn't show error dialog anymore when wrong password is entered</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p class="nan2">Updates and Fixes in 3.8.1</p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.1.5</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.1.5 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">Important Changes and Fixes</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard works behind a proxy again</li>
<li>Spring Boot Dashboard expose via ngrok feature work wells with multiple launch configs now</li>
<li>In addition to templates for logging errors and warnings, there is a new logd template for logging debug output</li>
<li>A newer version of CFT made it into STS 3.8.1 which provides an improved packaging mechanism for deploying Spring Boot apps</li>
<li>Assert templates now use JUnit or AssertJ, depending on what is on the classpath of the project</li>
<li>Spring Boot dashboard now shows only one port when the app uses a dynamic port and has boot devtools enabled</li>
<li>Fixed a problem that caused services to continue to show up on the boot dashboard even though there was an error connecting to the CF target</li>
<li>Fixed a ConcurrentModificationException in the boot dashboard</li>
<li>The sorting of the CF targets in the boot dashboard now takes customized labels into account</li>
<li>The reactive streams bundle is now signed</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Groovy-Eclipse m2e connector with missing source folders</li>
<li>Added an action to jump to the ngrok admin web UI directly from the boot dashboard</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the port of a boot app not showing up in the dashboard</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the boot dashboard not identifying the starting state of a boot app correctly</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the dialog that lets you select a manifest when deploying an app to CF (let you deploy even in case of an error in the manifest file)</li>
</ul>

<p class="nan3">Requirements</p>
<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run properly.</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Neon (4.6.0)</p>
<p>The default STS distribution is now based on the recently released Eclipse Neon (4.6) release.</p>

<p>Highlights from this Eclipse Neon release include substring code completion for Java content
	assist, word-wrap in text editors, commands/shortcuts/pinch gestures to zoom into text editors (especially
	useful when giving presentations), and more. Please find additional details in the
	<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy/">Eclipse Neon New and Noteworthy</a>.</p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.1.4</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.1.4 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">Support for Spring Insight removed</p>
<p>The support for Spring Insight that was part of the tc-server support got removed.</p>

<p class="nan3">Buildship notification</p>
<p>We added a plugin from Eclipse Buildship to notify our users of using Eclipse Buildship instead of the legacy
	STS support for Gradle in the future.</p>

<p class="nan2">Spring Tooling</p>

<p class="nan3"><a name="bootdash"></a><a name="targetlabels"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: customizable labels for CF targets</p>
<p>You can now change the labels for CF target nodes in the Boot Dashboard. To do so, right-click a node and 
select "Customize... -> Customize Label...":</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/customize-target-labels.png"></img></center><br>
<p>You can type in any name you like. In addition to plain text you can also use a few placeholders in there:</p>
<br/><ul>
	<li><b>%u: </b>the user name that you defined when accessing the Cloud Foundry target</li>
	<li><b>%s: </b>the space that you selected for the Cloud Foundry target</li>
	<li><b>%o: </b>the name of the organisation that you selected for the Cloud Foundry target</li>
	<li><b>%a: </b>the API endpoint URL</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you don't remember those placeholders, don't worry. You can hover over the text field for some help.</p>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="multiappmanifests"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: advanced support for multi-app manifest files</p>
<p>A single <tt>manifest.yml</tt> may specify deployment properties for multiple applications. When deploying an app, 
the Deployment Properties dialog's YAML Content section highlights application names and allows the user to choose one,
by clicking on the visual annotations in the vertical ruler.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/boot-dashboard-multi-app-manifest.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="rememberpassword"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: choose to remember password or not</p>
<p>The Cloud Foundry Target creation wizard and login dialog now have a "Remember Password" check-box. If you choose not to remember the password
then you will be prompted to enter Cloud Foundry login credentials when connecting to the Cloud Foundry target or after restarting STS. Otherwise, 
the password will be stored in Secure Storage and you will not be prompted to enter the password again. Note that on Linux, you
will still be prompted for the Secure Storage master password.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/boot-dashboard-cf-targets-connected.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="skipsslvalidation"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: Skip SSL validation for Cloud Foundry targets</p>
<p>Skipping SSL validation is now supported when creating Cloud Foundry targets in the Spring Boot Dashboard.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/boot-dashboard-cf-skip-ssl.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="appsmanagerURL"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: customizable apps manager URL</p>
<p>The boot dashboard allows you to quickly jump to the web console of the apps manager of a Cloud Foundry target
	that you confgured in the boot dashboard. However, the URL of the apps manager can vary, depending on the
	version and configuration of your PCF installation. Therefore the boot dashboard allows you to customize the
	URL it uses to jump to that web console (via "Customize... -> Customize Cloud Admin Console URL"):</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/boot-dashboard-customize-apps-manager.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="filterbyname"></a>Spring Boot Dashboard: filter apps by project name</p>
<p>The filter in the boot dashboard is now also aware of project names. No need to organize your projects
	into working sets anymore, just type in a part of the project name and see the filtered list of projects
	in the boot dashboard.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/filter-by-project-name.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="codetemplates"></a>Spring Boot: Additional code templates</p>

<p>Based on input from Spring Boot Core developers we have created some code
templates useful in developing Spring/Spring Boot apps.</p>
<p>The templates are invoked through Eclipse's content-assist (i.e. you press CTRL-SPACE) and shown as completions
when you type the template's name (or even just a part of the name).<p>
<p>Some templates are context-sensitive. This means that there are multiple versions of the template that expand
into a different pattern depending on the context you are in. For example the <tt>notnull</tt> template expands to something
that uses JUnit's assert in test code; it expands into something that uses Spring's assert anywhere else.</p>
<p>Below is a table showing all the templates we have added in this release:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name[context]</th> 
        <th>Screenshot</th> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>main</td>
        <td><img src="screenshot/template-main.png"></img></td>

<p class="nan3"><a name="jar-type-search-confirmation"></a>Spring Boot: JAR type search now asks for confirmation</p>
<p>
"Jar Type Search" is a feature that was introduced in <a href="http://docs.spring.io/sts/nan/v350/NewAndNoteworthy.html">STS 3.5.0</a>.
It provides content-assist proposals in Spring Boot projects, for types that are not (yet) on the classpath. When selecting such a proposal
the required dependency is automatically added to the project's maven pom.</p>
<p>Some people liked this, but others found it confusing or annoying rather than helpful because it was too easy to add undesirable elements
to a pom accidentally.</p>

<p>STS 3.8.0 addresses this by asking for explicit confirmation before making changes to your pom. 
The confirmation dialog also has a "Disable" button, which you can click 
to disable it completely.</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/jar-type-search-confirm.png"></img></center>

<p class="nan3"><a name="codetemplates"></a>Spring Boot: trigger devtools restart manually</p>
<p>Spring Boot applications that have the boot devtools included in their classpath can quickly be restarted
	(without shutting down the JVM completely). This can now be triggered manually from the console:</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/devtools-restart-trigger.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3"><a name="ymlediting"></a>Improvements to the Spring Boot YML and Properties Editors</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Validation of comma-separated lists in the <tt>.properties</tt> editor</b></p>

<p>The Spring Boot Properties editor now knows how to check the validity of a list of comma-separated
values. For example:</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/props-reconcile-comma-lists.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Content-assist in comma-separated lists in the <tt>.properties</tt> editor</b></p>

<center><img src="screenshot/props-content-assist-comma-lists.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Quickfix for deprecated properties in yml and properties editor</b></p>
<p>Both the yml and properties editor now provide a quickfix for deprecated property names (if the property
defines a replacement in its metadata).

<center><img src="screenshot/yml-quickfix-deprecated.png"></img></center>

<p>Note: The yml quickfix is smart enough to move a renamed property to a different place in 
the yml structure as needed:</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/yml-quickfix-deprecated-before-and-after.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Basic content-assist for 'Resource' type in yml/props editor</b></p>

<p>Both the yml and properties editor now provide some basic content assist for configuration properties of
type <tt>org.springframework.core.io.Resource</tt>. Content assist suggestions are generated by
scanning your project's source-folders for 'resources'. In a future release we may extend this to do
a broader scan to look also for 'resources' in the project's dependencies.</p>

<center><img src="screenshot/yml-content-assist-resource.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Support for 'class-reference' value provider</b><p>

<p>Configuration properties with 'value provider' metadata of type 'class-reference' now are handled by both the yml and properties
editor. For example property <tt>spring.data.mongodb.field-naming-strategy</tt> comes with the following metadata attached:</p>

<center><img src="screenshot/class-reference-metadata-example.png"></img></center>

<p>The editor now understands what this means and will suggest names of classes that implement the <tt>FieldNamingStrategy</tt> interface from the
project's classpath.</p>

<center><img src="screenshot/yml-content-assist-class-reference.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Support for <tt>handle-as</tt> value-provider</b></p>

<p>Handle-as value provider can be used in spring-boot configuration property metadata to designate that a property ostensibly declared
as a vanilla type such as <tt>String</tt> should be treated as something more specific (e.g. <tt>org.springframework.core.io.Resource</tt>).
Both yml and properties editor now understand this metadata.</p>

<p><b>Check for duplicate keys in yml and properties editor</b></p>

<p>Both the yml and properties editor now check for duplicate keys and flag them with an error marker:</p> 

<center><img src="screenshot/yml-reconcile-duplicate-keys.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Better handling of enum values in yml and properties editor</b></p>

<p>Both yml and properties editor now are able to show the JavaDoc for enum values when hovering over them or in the side-panel of
a content-assist suggestion. For example:</p>

<center><img src="screenshot/yml-hover-enum-key.png"></img></center>

<p><b>Note 1:</b> Hyperlink navigation with 'CTRL-Click' now also works for enum values, taking you to the source-code of the corresponding enum constant.</p>

<p><b>Note 2:</b>JavaDoc in Eclipse in general, is only available when source-jars have been downloaded and associated with the binary jars. If you do not get JavaDoc hovers where you expect them, verify that source code for the enum in question is attached before reporting this as a bug.</p>
<p><b>Note 3:</b>There are still cases, especially in the properties editor, where hover-info and/or CTRL-click does not yet work, in particular when the enum-value occurs on the left-hand-side of the '=' of a property-assignment. We plan to resolve these issues in a future release.</p>

<p class="nan2"><a name="cfmanifesteditor"></a>Cloud Foundry Manifest YML Editor</p>
<p><b>Content Assist for Cloud Foundry Buildpacks</b></p>
<p>Content assist for buildpacks now proposes buildpacks dynamically from Cloud Foundry targets in the Spring Boot Dashboard. It will list buildpacks from any Cloud Foundry target, not just Pivotal Web Services.</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/manifest-editor-buildpack-contentassist.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan2"><a name="developerproductivity"></a>Developer Productivity Bits</p>

<p>We implemented a number of little things to improve the general developer productivity when working with the
	Spring Tool Suite and Eclipse. Here are the little improvements in detail.</p>
<br/>

<p><b>Additional code templates</b></p>

<p>Based on input from Spring Boot Core developers we have created some code
templates useful in Java apps in general. Below is a list of the templates that where added as a result:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name[context]</th> 
        <th>Screenshot</th> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>asl</td>
        <td><img src="screenshot/template-asl.png"></img></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>jumock</td>
        <td><img src="screenshot/template-jumock.png"></img></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>eerule[test-member]</td>
        <td><img src="screenshot/template-eerule-test-member.png"></img></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>eerule[test-statement]</td>
        <td><img src="screenshot/template-eerule-test-statement.png"></img></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>formatter-off</td>
        <td><img src="screenshot/template-formatter-off.png"></img></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Note: The "formatter-off" template is special and can be applied from 
the "Surround With..." menu:</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/template-surround-with.png"></img></center>
<br/>

<p><b>Toggle Line Number Visibility Action:</b></p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/toggle-line-numbers.png"></img></center>
<br>

<p><b>Want to rename tests, too?</b></p>
<p>After you rename a class, STS will check if there is a test class with a similar name. If it finds one, it will 
ask you if you want to rename that too.</p>
<center><img src="screenshot/rename-test-too.png"></img></center>
<p><b>More Defaults for Static Imports in Favorites</b></p>
<p>Additional default types containing static members have been added to Content Assist for imports, including some from springframework libraries. Users can customize the list through "Favorites" preferences, as well
as restore the default list.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="screenshot/content-assist-spring-static-members-imports.png"></img></center>
</br>
<br/>

<p><b>Improved Quickfix for Unresolved Types in Assignments</b></p>
<p>Quickfix on unresolved Java types now matches the return type of an assignment statement.</p>
<br>
<center><img src="screenshot/quickfix-unresolved-types-matching.png"></img></center>
</br>
<p>Java quickfix improvements in STS can be disabled, and the original Eclipse JDT quickfix feature restored, by adding the following VM arg to the STS.ini file and restarting STS:</p>
<p>-Denable.sts.quickfix.imports=false</p>
<br/>

<h2>Known issues in this release</h2>

<h3>macOS Sierra might cause loss of settings and installed plugins</h3>

<p>If you unpackage the STS archive on macOS Sierra and use it without moving it to a different location on your
	drive, macOS Sierra Gatekeeper activates a security feature called "Path Randomization" for the app. This causes
	the STS.app bundle to be copied to a private and randomized read-only folder on your disc every time you start
	STS after a restart of your machine. As a result, all your third-party installs are lost as well as your global
	configuration. As a workaround, please move the STS.app bundle to a different location on your drive before
	starting it.</p>
	<p>The corresponding issue in the STS issue tracker:
		<a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-4406">STS-4406: STS 3.8.2 and MacOS Sierra</a></p>
		<p>The corresponding bug at Eclipse: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507328">Bug 507328 - Eclipse forgets about global settings and installed features </a></p>
<br/>

<h3>Spring Boot dashboard ngrok tunneling feature doesn't support Spring Cloud Services yet</h3>

<p>The Spring Boot Dashboards ngrok tunnel feature doesn't work yet with remote service registries from Spring Cloud Services.
	  Instead it works with self-deployed Eureka service registry apps on CF only (as described
	  <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/10/15/the-spring-boot-dashboard-in-sts-part-2-working-with-cloud-foundry">here</a>). We
	  are working on enhancing the ngrok tunnel feature to directly support Spring Cloud Services in the near future. In the meantime
	  we published a tech note that describes <a href="http://static.springsource.org/sts/nan/v373/SpringToolSuite-LocalServicesAndSCS.html">
      how to setup ngrok tunneling in combination with SCS manually</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Conflicting duplicate lifecycle mapping errors in Maven projects upgrading from STS 3.6.x</h3>

<p>Sometimes Maven projects show up with a red error (talking about a duplicate lifecycle mapping conflict) after upgrading STS
	from 3.6.x to the latest 3.7.2 version. In this case, please update the Maven support for Eclipse/STS to the latest version,
	as described here: <a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-4236?focusedCommentId=108387&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-108387">STS-4236</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Error after updating from STS 3.7.0</h3>

<p>Sometimes after updating an existing STS 3.7.0 installation to 3.7.1 an error dialog pops up and STS doesn't start. This
	is a known but not yet solved problem. If you come across this issue, please press "OK" on the dialog and restart STS. It
	will open up fine, including all the updated components.</p>
<br/>

<h3>No repository available when checking for updates</h3>

<p>If you have used a pre-release version of Eclipse Mars or STS, the embedded Eclipse Oomph technology created a cache
of p2 repositores in your home directory. This cached p2 data can cause issues when using STS 3.7.0 or Eclipse Mars. The
error message looks like STS/Eclipse fails to read information from the main Eclipse Mars p2 repository.</p>
<p>In case you encounter this error, please stop Eclipse/STS, go to your home directory, delete "~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.p2",
and restart Eclipse/STS. The related Eclipse bug is: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470912">Bug 470912</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Live configuration-metadata generation requires Spring Boot 1.2.2</h3>

<p>Spring Boot 1.2.1 configuration processor does not work correctly when executed
from Eclipse's incremental build. This issue is fixed in Spring Boot 1.2.2.
This only affects 'live' metadata generated from your own source code, not the
metadata that is packaged inside spring-boot jars themselves. So you can still 
use older versions of Boot, but the 'live metadata' updates 
will not be accurate. See Spring Boot issue 
<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2313">GH-2313</a>
for details.</p>
<br>

<h3>Dashboard and Retina Displays</h3>

<p>When running STS on top of a JDK7, the new dashboard looks a bit blurry when using a HiRes (Retina) display, for example on a Retina MacBook Pro. This is due to the
underlying browser technology that is used to display the dashboard content and that is coming from JavaFX. The JavaFX version that ships with JDK7 doesn't support
retina displays. The solution for this is to run STS on top of a JDK8 build. The JavaFX version that comes with JDK8 supports retina displays.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Dashboard on JDK9</h3>

<p>The JavaFX-based main STS dashboard doesn't work when running STS on top of an early-access version of JDK9. As a workaround run STS on a JDK8 or switch
	the dashboard back to the old (non-JavaFX-based) version via the preferences.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Silent loss of Functionality on Java 7 or earlier</h3>

<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run on top of. If you are running it with an older JDK this may not be immediatlely apparant, but some of 
STS functionality will simply be 'absent' because the corresponding plugins are automatically disabled by OSGI because their requirements
are not satisfied at runtime. See also below 'Setting the JDK'.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Setting the JDK</h3>

<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run on top of. Nevertheless the native Eclipse launcher component might pick up a JRE or an older JDK automatically 
if you don't specify which JDK to run STS on top of. To avoid this, you can specify the JDK in the sts.ini file that comes with your STS installation. 
Add a line at the beginning "-vm" and an additional line below that which points to the "javaw" executable of the JDK on your machine.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Issues on Linux (GTK3)</h3>

<p>Eclipse 4.5, upon which STS and GGTS are based, is the first Eclipse release where GTK3 is the default for the SWT widget library.
There are some issues with this still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>STS New Dashboard doesn't work under GTK3 because it uses JavaFX which is not currently compatible with GTK3. Instead the old dashboard will
      open.
  <li>The Eclipse editor may be slow to respond (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434898">Eclipse Bug 434898</a>).
</ul>

<p>You may also experience other UI rendering glitches. If you exprience any of these problems you can avoid them by forcing SWT to 
switch back to using GTK2. Just set the environment variable "SWT_GTK3=0" before launching STS or GGTS.
