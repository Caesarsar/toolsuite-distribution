SPRINGSOURCE, INC. END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

BEFORE USING THE SPRINGSOURCE, INC, ("SPRINGSOURCE") SOFTWARE ("SOFTWARE"), ANY 
ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION ("DOCUMENTATION", TOGETHER WITH THE SOFTWARE, THE 
"PRODUCT") OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE PROVIDED WITH THE 
SOFTWARE, READ CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS END USER 
LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") BETWEEN SPRINGSOURCE AND THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON 
OR ENTITY ("LICENSEE") RECEIVING THE SOFTWARE TO WHICH THIS AGREEMENT IS 
ATTACHED, OR INTO WHICH THIS AGREEMENT IS EMBEDDED. BY USING THE PRODUCT OR ANY 
PART THEREOF, OR BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" BELOW, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE 
READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT 
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BIND THE ENTITY RECEIVING THE PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT 
AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL OR 
USE THE PRODUCT.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF LICENSEE HAS ENTERED INTO 
ANOTHER VALID AGREEMENT WITH SPRINGSOURCE THAT COVERS THE PRODUCT (WHETHER OR 
NOT SUCH VALID AGREEMENT WAS PHYSICALLY EXECUTED BY LICENSEE, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY "CLICK-THROUGH" AGREEMENT OR ANY APPLICABLE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS POSTED ON ANY SPRINGSOURCE WEBSITE), THEN THE FOLLOWING LICENSE 
AGREEMENT TERMS ARE SUPERSEDED BY SUCH OTHER VALID AGREEMENT, AND DO NOT APPLY 
TO LICENSEE'S USE OF THE PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT APPLIES 
ONLY TO THE PRODUCT AND DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, INCLUDING 
OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS, AS MAY BE LISTED IN THE LICENSES DIRECTORY OR SPECIFIED 
IN THE DOCUMENTATION. SUCH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS LICENSED UNDER THE TERMS OF 
THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY LICENSE AGREEMENT LISTED IN THE LICENSES DIRECTORY 
OR SPECIFIED IN THE DOCUMENTATION.

1.  License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
SpringSource agrees to grant, and does hereby grant to Licensee during the term 
of this Agreement, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right and 
license, solely to the object code version of the Software, and to the 
Documentation and any other materials provided to Licensee by SpringSource 
hereunder ("Materials"), without the right to grant or authorize sublicenses or 
to further distribute the Product or Materials, to install the Software on 
computers owned or leased by Licensee and to use the Product and Materials 
solely for Licensee's internal business operations, development, evaluation, 
and educational purposes ("Permitted Uses"). The Product and Materials may not 
be used for any purpose other than for Permitted Uses, and may not be used by 
any other person or entity other than Licensee.  Licensee may make up to two 
copies of the Product for backup and/or archival purposes.  

2.  License Restrictions. Licensee agrees not to: (a) copy or use the Product 
in any manner except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (b) transfer, 
sell, rent, lease, distribute, or sublicense the Product to any third party; 
(c) use the Product for providing time-sharing services, service bureau 
services or as part of an application services provider or as a service 
offering; (d) reverse engineer (except as permitted by applicable law), 
disassemble, decompile the Products; (e) alter modify, enhance or prepare any 
derivative work from, the Product; (f) alter or remove any proprietary notices 
in the Product; or (g) make available to any third party any analysis of the 
results of operation of the Product, including benchmarking results, without 
the prior written consent of SpringSource. 

3.  Ownership. The Product and Materials are and shall remain the sole property 
of SpringSource and its licensors, and, except as expressly provided herein, 
SpringSource and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to 
the Product or Materials, including all intellectual property rights therein 
and thereto.

4.  Requirements of Licensee. Licensee may provide feedback regarding the 
Product including without limitation any functionality issues, and errors, 
flaws, failures, or faults in the Product (collectively, "Feedback") via an 
online SpringSource forum or other method.   Licensee hereby grants to 
SpringSource a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable, 
royalty-free, fully-paid, right and license to use and exploit in any manner 
and for any purpose all Feedback and related information.

5.  Confidential Information. The Product and Materials contain Confidential 
Information and trade secrets of SpringSource and its licensors. "Confidential 
Information" means all software code and information furnished by SpringSource 
in oral, written or machine-readable form, disclosed as a result of this 
Agreement, and that should reasonably have been understood by Licensee, because 
of legends or other markings, the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of 
the information itself, to be proprietary and confidential to SpringSource, a 
SpringSource affiliate or other third party. Licensee will use the same 
standard of care to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of the 
Confidential Information that Licensee uses to prevent the disclosure of its 
own similar confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable 
standard of care.  Licensee will disclose the Confidential Information only to 
its employees with a need to know for the purposes of this Agreement. The 
restrictions of this Agreement on use and disclosure of Confidential 
Information shall not apply to information that becomes publicly known through 
no fault of the Licensee or its personnel. All obligations regarding 
Confidential Information received prior to the expiration or termination of 
this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

6.  Warranty Disclaimer. THE PRODUCT AND THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY OF DATA, 
SYSTEM INTEGRATION, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
 SPRINGSOURCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT THE USE OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE 
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

7.  Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL SPRINGSOURCE BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
CLAIM BASED UPON A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT, 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE; OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH 
ANY MALFUNCTIONS, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, 
INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATORY PROFITS, EVEN IF 
SPRINGSOURCE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
SPRINGSOURCE'S AGGREGATE AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO 
THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR OTHERWISE 
WILL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES AND WILL NOT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (US 
$1,000).  THE ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 7 REPRESENT THE AGREED 
AND BARGAINED FOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES, AND THE COMPENSATION OF 
SPRINGSOURCE FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER REFLECTS SUCH ALLOCATIONS. THE 
FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ALLOCATION OF THE RISK 
BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

8. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement will begin on the earlier 
of the date this Agreement is accepted by Licensee or Licensee's first use of 
the Product and end on the date this Agreement is terminated by either party.  
This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon written 
notice to the other party.  Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, 
Licensee will use reasonable efforts to deinstall and destroy the Product or 
return the Product and Materials to SpringSource. Termination will not affect 
any claim, liability or right arising prior to termination. All rights and 
obligations granted under Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Agreement 
will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

9.  Government Rights. The Products under this Agreement are "commercial 
computer Products" as that term is described in DFAR 252.227-7014(a)(1).  If 
acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency, the U.S. Government acquires 
this commercial computer Products and/or commercial computer Products 
documentation subject to the terms and this Agreement as specified in 48C.F.R. 
12.212 (Computer Products) and 12.11 (Technical Data) of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations ("FAR") and its successors.  If acquired by or on 
behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense ("DOD"), the U.S. 
Government acquires this commercial computer Products and/or commercial 
computer Products documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement as 
specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 of the DOD FAR Supplement and its successors. 
Licensee will not export the Products in violation of the export laws of the 
United States or of any other country.

10. General. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the 
parties concerning the subject matter hereof, notwithstanding any different or 
additional terms that may be contained in the form of purchase order or other 
document used by Licensee to place orders or otherwise effect transactions 
hereunder, which such terms are hereby rejected. This Agreement supersedes all 
prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals and agreements between the 
parties relating to the subject matter hereof, provided that if Licensee has 
entered into or later enters into another valid agreement with SpringSource 
regarding the Product (whether or not such other valid agreement was physically 
executed by Licensee, including without limitation any "click-through" 
agreement or any applicable terms and conditions posted on any SpringSource 
website), then such other agreement shall supersede this Agreement. No 
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be 
effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. If any provision of 
this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions 
will remain in full force and effect and such provision will be enforced to the 
maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and will be 
reformed to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
No waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any actions or failures 
to enforce rights under this Agreement. Neither party will be liable to the 
other for any delay or failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable 
control (excluding payment of monies due). Unless otherwise specifically 
stated, the terms of this Agreement are intended to be and are solely for the 
benefit of SpringSource and Licensee and do not create any right in favor of 
any third party. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the United States and the State of California without 
reference to its conflict of laws principles. All disputes arising out of or 
relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of a 
court of competent jurisdiction located in the Northern District of California 
or a state court located in San Francisco, California, and each party 
irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to 
this venue. All notices must be in writing and will be effective three (3) days 
after the date sent.

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the 
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the 
best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public 
domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby 
dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship 
identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, 
dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and 
to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends 
this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all 
present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, 
in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights 
includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) 
those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be 
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or 
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or 
conceived.
