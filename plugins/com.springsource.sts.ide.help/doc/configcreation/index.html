<p>There are two entry points to creating a new bean configuration
file:</p>
<ul>
	<li>New Wizard: Go to <i>File -&gt; New -&gt; Spring Bean
	Configuration File</i></li>
	<blockquote></blockquote>
	<li>Package Explorer: Right click in the view and select <i>New
	-&gt; Spring Bean Configuration File</i></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="newconfigmenu.png"></p>
<p>This will invoke a new file wizard that will help step you
through the file creation process. Select a name and parent project for
the new file. At this point you can hit the finish button and a new file
will be created for you, or you can hit the next button to continue
through the wizard. If you choose to continue, you will be presented
with a page for defining your namespace imports, and then another page
for defining your config sets.</p>
<p><img src="newconfigwizard.png"></p>
<p>When you are done. A new bean configuration file will be created
for you and opened in the <a href="../configurationediting/index.html">configuration
editor</a>.</p>
