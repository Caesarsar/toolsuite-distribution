<h2 class="title">SpringSource dm Server Tooling</h2><p>
		SpringSource provides a set of plug-ins for the Eclipse IDE that streamline the development
		lifecycle of OSGi bundles and PAR applications. The dm Server Tools build on top
		of the Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) and Spring IDE, the open-source Spring development 
		tool set.
	</p><p>
		The dm Server Tools support the creation of new OSGi bundle and PAR projects within Eclipse, convert
		existing projects, and deploy and debug those projects on a running dm Server right
		from within Eclipse.
