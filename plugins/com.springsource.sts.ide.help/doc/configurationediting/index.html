<p>The Namespaces tab of the configuration editor is designed for
editing the namespace declarations in the XML file. The left-hand table
displays all the namespace URIs available to the SpringSource Tool
Suite. Selecting a URI will display a table on the right-hand containing
all the known versions of that namespace schema. Click the checkboxes in
the URI table to add or remove namespaces from the XML file. Click a
checkbox in the version table to select a specific version of the
namespace schema. Note that the version table will appear disabled for
un-checked namespaces.</p>

<p>The configuration editor will host tabs for most of the
namespaces known to the SpringSource Tool Suite. The editor will only
display tabs for the namespaces declared in the XML file, and tabs will
be added and removed to the editor as namespaces are added or removed
from the XML file. When a change in namespace declaration occurs, a
dialog will appear reminding the user that the editor tabs have changed.
The dialog can be dismissed permanently by checking off the 'Don't
remind me again.' button.</p>

<p>The Overview tab of the configuration editor provides you with a
view of every element in the XML file. The left-hand table displays all
the elements in the XML file starting with the root beans element.
Selecting an element will display a details page on the right-hand
containing all of the attributes for that element. Most elements will
have an additional section on their details page with documentation
explaining the element's purpose. Below you can see that the
propertyChangeTracker bean has been selected and its id and class are on
display. Elements with a large number of attributes such as this one
will contain an Advanced Attributes section that is collapsed by
default.</p>

<p>Configuration files with a large number of elements can become
difficult to navigate. The elements table contains a text filter to help
simplify element navigation. Below you can see the elements table
filtered on the text 'prop', displaying only the relevant bean and
aspect.</p>

<p>The configuration editor will host tabs for most of the
namespaces known to the SpringSource Tool Suite. These namespace
specific tabs are a great way to scope down a large XML file. Below we
can see the same file on the 'aop' tab. Only the elements from the aop
namespace are on display.</p>
<p><img src="aop.png"></p>
<p>Below we see the same file on the 'beans' tab. In this example a
combo box has been selected and we see all its possible values. The
configuration editor is aware of all attributes with pre-defined values
and will displays these as combo selections.</p>
<p><img src="beans.png"></p>
<p>When a text field is selected, a light bulb icon will appear if
the attribute supports content proposals. Hitting CTRL-SPACE will bring
up a list of possible values for the attribute. In this example an
aspect has been selected and we can see two bean proposals for the
aspect's ref attribute.</p>

<p>Adding a new element to the configuration file is as simple as
selecting the parent and right clicking. A menu will appear listing all
the possible children, separated by namespace with the default namespace
at the top. New bean definitions can also be creating by clicking the
'New Bean...' button, which will invoke the <a
	href="../beanwizard/index.html">new bean wizard</a>.</p>
