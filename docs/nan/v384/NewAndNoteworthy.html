<h1 class="nan1">Spring Tool Suite 3.8.4: New and Noteworthy</h1>

<p>
	Josh Long published a nice Spring Tips video, introducing the Spring Tool Suite.</p>
</br>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mtI4vmsQ08?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>We would also like to thank our users for using the automated error reporting that we included since the 3.8.2 release and for
	sending us all those error reports. We used them to fix issues and improve reliability in this
	release. And we will continue to do that. So please keep those error reports coming!</p>

<p class="nan3">Issues now tracked on GitHub Issues</p>

<p>Issues around the Spring Tool Suite and the Spring IDE are tracked on GitHub from now on:
	<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/issues</a>.</p>
<br/>

<p class="nan2">Updates and New/Enhanced Features in 3.8.4</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Neon.3 (4.6.3)</p>
<p>The default STS distribution is now based on the recently released Eclipse Neon.3 (4.6.3) release.</p>

<p class="nan3">Pivotal tc Server updated to 3.2.4.SR1</p>
<p>The latest Pivotal tc Server release 3.2.4.SR1 is now included in the STS distribution bundle.</p>

<p class="nan3">Early Access for Eclipse Oxygen 4.7 available</p>
<p>Since STS 3.8.4 we have early-access versions available for the latest Eclipse Oxygen 4.7 builds. You can
	find the update site here:</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.7">http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/update/e4.7</a>
</p>
<p><b>Attention:</b> Eclipse Oxygen M6 has a severe bug that prevents the JEE, Java, and STS packages to work properly. If you want
	to install STS into Eclipse 4.7, you need to make sure to use post-M6 builds of Eclipse Oxygen as a base.</p>
<p>
	You can also download complete STS distribution packages based on early Eclipse 4.7 versions from our nightly downloads page at: <a href ="http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/STS/nightly-distributions.html">http://dist.springsource.com/snapshot/STS/nightly-distributions.html</a>.
	Those distribution packages already contain a fix for the bug and therefore can be used out-of-the-box.
</p>

<p class="nan3">Eclipse Data Tools removed</p>
<p>Due to various users reporting issues related to the Eclipse Data Tools that we included in STS, we decided to remove
	those features from the default STS distribution. We added an item to the dashboard extension install listing
	that makes it easy for you to get them back into your STS in case you would like to use them.</p>

<p class="nan3">Buildship 2.0 import strategy for Getting Started Wizards</p>

<p>The "New Spring Starter Project" and "Import Getting Started Content" now provide a "Buildship 2.x"
import strategy. For backwards compatibility the old import startegy which supports "Buildship 1.x" is
also still available.</p>

<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/buildship_20.png"></img></center><br>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Revamped UI for the "New Spring Starter" and "Edit Starters" Wizards</p>

<p>
	Users can now specify a custom initializr service in the first page of the wizard. A new dropdown widget at the top of
	the page allows users to type a URL or select one from the dropdown. URLs entered in the widget will be saved in the
	Initializr Preference page only after the starter wizard finishes, and users can edit the URLs from there. The content
	of the wizard dynamically changes when a valid service URL is entered.
<p>
<p>
	This is particularly useful when you have your own or even multiple custom spring initilizr services running in-house.
</p>

<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/starter-wizard-custom-url.png"></img></center>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/initializr-preference-page.png"></img></center>

<p>
	The UI for the dependencies page now features a more intuitive two-column layout. Available dependencies are shown in the left column
	and selected dependencies on the right. A search box at the top of the first column filters the list of available dependencies.
</p>
<p>
	You can easily select dependencies from the left list by checking them and remove them from the list of selected items on the right via
	the grey "x" in front of their name.
</p>

<br/>
 <center><img src="screenshot/starter-wizard-dependencies.png"></img></center>

<p>
	There are also links to further documentation available for most of the spring boot starter modules. Hover with the mouse over the
	item and links to the relevant documentation will appear.
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/starter-wizard-hover.png"></img></center>
	
<p>
	If you edit your dependencies in the pom.xml editor that comes with Eclipse and STS, we added a shortcut to open the wizard to
	the list of available content-assists. That way you can easily open the wizard and add or remove spring boot starter modules
	to and from your pom.xml file.
</p>

<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/edit-starters-shortcut.png"></img></center>

<br/>

<p class="nan3">Spring Cloud CLI Integration - Local Services in the Boot Dash</p>

<p>
	Spring Cloud CLI available services are shown in the Boot Dashboard under <b>local</b>
	run target below the Spring Boot project entries. The Boot Dashboard provides the expected life cycle management
	control features over Cloud services provided by Spring Cloud CLI such as starting and stopping a service. In order
	to see these services in the Boot Dashboard one would need to point STS to a Spring Boot CLI installation <u>with 
	Spring Cloud CLI installed in it</u> via preferences <b>Spring->Boot->CLI</b>.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Attention:</b>The current limitation with this STS integration is that it is not aware of any Spring Cloud CLI
	services that you started started manually on the command line (instead of within STS).
</p>
<p>
	There is also an option in the dashboard view menu to disable (and hide) the local cloud services from your boot
	dashboard, in case you don't want to use this and don't want to spend cycles to access them.
</p>

<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/spring-cloud-cli-boot-dash.png"/></center>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/spring-cloud-cli-prefs.png"/></center>
<br/>

<p class="nan3">Cloud Foundry - Added support for "routes"</p>

<p>
    Users can now specify routes with paths, or TCP routes with ports if the Cloud Foundry target supports TCP.
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/routes-tcp.png"></img></center>

<p>
	<b>Attention:</b> "random-route" property does not yet work with "routes", so if specifying a TCP route, an explicit
	port needs to be set in the route.
</p>

<p>
	We also added content assist and basic validation in the manifest editor. The basic validation in the manifest editor
	detects if legacy <code>domain(s)</code>, <code>host(s)</code> or <code>no-hostname</code> were used with the new
	<code>routes</code> property in the same manifest and report errors appropriately.
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/cf-manifest-reconcile.png"></img></center>

<p>
  	The merge dialog for deployment manifests also got support for <code>routes</code>. Additional paths on routes are
	not yet supported (known limitation). That will follow soon.
</p>
<br/>
<center><img src="screenshot/cf-manifest-compare-merge.png"></img></center>

<p class="nan3">Important Changes and Fixes</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Wrong character and font display on Spring Dashboard fixed</li>
<li>Request Mappings are now shown in Request Mappings view for <code>@RepositoryRestController</code> classes</li>
<li>Environment settings are no longer lost when copying launch configs in boot dashboard</li>
<li>StsProperties (internal to the IDE) are no longer read from network, STS no longer hangs because of this</li>
<li>JMX used to get request mappings from running boot app, therefore don't need to lower security for HTTP for them</li>
<li>Improved UI in boot launch config editor for JMX settings</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with boot projects sometimes not showing up in boot dashboard after starting up STS</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with starting and stopping boot apps from the boot dashboard didn't work (forever spinning startup indicator)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when using CF targets in the boot dashboard that have a comma in their organisation name</li>
<li>Fixed a number of most-reported errors from the automated error reporting</li>
</ul>


<p class="nan2">Important Notes for 3.8.4</p>

<p class="nan3">macOS Sierra causes lost settings and lost add-on installs</p>

<p>If you unpackage the STS archive on macOS Sierra and use it without moving it to a different location on your
	drive, macOS Sierra Gatekeeper activates a security feature called "Path Randomization" for the app. This causes
	the STS.app bundle to be copied to a private and randomized read-only folder on your disc every time you start
	STS after a restart of your machine. As a result, all your third-party installs are lost as well as your global
	configuration. As a workaround, please move the STS.app bundle to a different location on your drive before
	starting it.</p>

<p class="nan3">Manual Maven support going to be removed soon</p>

<p>We plan to remove the support for manual Maven projects from STS and Spring IDE in future versions of STS and
	Spring IDE. The manual maven support was used in the past when projects used Maven, but didn't opt-in to use
	the direct Maven support in Eclipse via the m2e project. While projects can still decide to not use m2e for their
	projects, the support for that via additional menu actions in STS will be gone.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Known issues in this release</h2>

<h3>macOS Sierra might cause loss of settings and installed plugins</h3>

<p>If you unpackage the STS archive on macOS Sierra and use it without moving it to a different location on your
	drive, macOS Sierra Gatekeeper activates a security feature called "Path Randomization" for the app. This causes
	the STS.app bundle to be copied to a private and randomized read-only folder on your disc every time you start
	STS after a restart of your machine. As a result, all your third-party installs are lost as well as your global
	configuration. As a workaround, please move the STS.app bundle to a different location on your drive before

<br/>

<h3>Spring Boot dashboard ngrok tunneling feature doesn't support Spring Cloud Services yet</h3>

<p>The Spring Boot Dashboards ngrok tunnel feature doesn't work yet with remote service registries from Spring Cloud Services.
	  Instead it works with self-deployed Eureka service registry apps on CF only (as described
	  <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2015/10/15/the-spring-boot-dashboard-in-sts-part-2-working-with-cloud-foundry">here</a>). We
	  are working on enhancing the ngrok tunnel feature to directly support Spring Cloud Services in the near future. In the meantime
	  we published a tech note that describes <a href="http://static.springsource.org/sts/nan/v373/SpringToolSuite-LocalServicesAndSCS.html">
      how to setup ngrok tunneling in combination with SCS manually</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Conflicting duplicate lifecycle mapping errors in Maven projects upgrading from STS 3.6.x</h3>

<p>Sometimes Maven projects show up with a red error (talking about a duplicate lifecycle mapping conflict) after upgrading STS
	from 3.6.x to the latest 3.7.2 version. In this case, please update the Maven support for Eclipse/STS to the latest version,
	as described here: <a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS-4236?focusedCommentId=108387&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-108387">STS-4236</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Error after updating from STS 3.7.0</h3>

<p>Sometimes after updating an existing STS 3.7.0 installation to 3.7.1 an error dialog pops up and STS doesn't start. This
	is a known but not yet solved problem. If you come across this issue, please press "OK" on the dialog and restart STS. It
	will open up fine, including all the updated components.</p>
<br/>

<h3>No repository available when checking for updates</h3>

<p>If you have used a pre-release version of Eclipse Mars or STS, the embedded Eclipse Oomph technology created a cache
of p2 repositores in your home directory. This cached p2 data can cause issues when using STS 3.7.0 or Eclipse Mars. The
error message looks like STS/Eclipse fails to read information from the main Eclipse Mars p2 repository.</p>
<p>In case you encounter this error, please stop Eclipse/STS, go to your home directory, delete "~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.p2",
and restart Eclipse/STS. The related Eclipse bug is: <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470912">Bug 470912</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Live configuration-metadata generation requires Spring Boot 1.2.2</h3>

<p>Spring Boot 1.2.1 configuration processor does not work correctly when executed
from Eclipse's incremental build. This issue is fixed in Spring Boot 1.2.2.
This only affects 'live' metadata generated from your own source code, not the
metadata that is packaged inside spring-boot jars themselves. So you can still 
use older versions of Boot, but the 'live metadata' updates 
will not be accurate. See Spring Boot issue 
<a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2313">GH-2313</a>
for details.</p>
<br>

<h3>Dashboard and Retina Displays</h3>

<p>When running STS on top of a JDK7, the new dashboard looks a bit blurry when using a HiRes (Retina) display, for example on a Retina MacBook Pro. This is due to the
underlying browser technology that is used to display the dashboard content and that is coming from JavaFX. The JavaFX version that ships with JDK7 doesn't support
retina displays. The solution for this is to run STS on top of a JDK8 build. The JavaFX version that comes with JDK8 supports retina displays.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Dashboard on JDK9</h3>

<p>The JavaFX-based main STS dashboard doesn't work when running STS on top of an early-access version of JDK9. As a workaround run STS on a JDK8 or switch
	the dashboard back to the old (non-JavaFX-based) version via the preferences.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Silent loss of Functionality on Java 7 or earlier</h3>

<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run on top of. If you are running it with an older JDK this may not be immediatlely apparant, but some of 
STS functionality will simply be 'absent' because the corresponding plugins are automatically disabled by OSGI because their requirements
are not satisfied at runtime. See also below 'Setting the JDK'.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Setting the JDK</h3>

<p>STS 3.8.0 requires a JDK 8 to run on top of. Nevertheless the native Eclipse launcher component might pick up a JRE or an older JDK automatically 
if you don't specify which JDK to run STS on top of. To avoid this, you can specify the JDK in the sts.ini file that comes with your STS installation. 
Add a line at the beginning "-vm" and an additional line below that which points to the "javaw" executable of the JDK on your machine.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Issues on Linux (GTK3)</h3>

<p>Eclipse 4.5, upon which STS and GGTS are based, is the first Eclipse release where GTK3 is the default for the SWT widget library.
There are some issues with this still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>STS New Dashboard doesn't work under GTK3 because it uses JavaFX which is not currently compatible with GTK3. Instead the old dashboard will
      open.
  <li>The Eclipse editor may be slow to respond (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434898">Eclipse Bug 434898</a>).
</ul>

<p>You may also experience other UI rendering glitches. If you exprience any of these problems you can avoid them by forcing SWT to 
switch back to using GTK2. Just set the environment variable "SWT_GTK3=0" before launching STS or GGTS.
