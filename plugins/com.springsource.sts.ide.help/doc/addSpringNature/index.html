Project</h2>

<p>Projects that are created through the <a
	href="../createProject/index.html">Spring Project wizard</a> will
automatically have the Spring nature applied to them, but there are
times when you are working with a project that does not have the Spring
nature. You can add a Spring nature to a project by right clicking it in
the Package Explorer and selecting Add Spring Project Nature from the
Spring Tools menu.</p>
