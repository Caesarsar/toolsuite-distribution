Editor</h2>

<p>The configuration editor provides a rich visual editing component
for Spring Integration configuration files, including support for all of
the core Spring Integration adapter namespaces. Managing adapter
namespaces is done through the <a
	href="../configurationediting/index.html">Namespaces tab</a> of the
configuration editor, just like any other namespace. Instead of creating
a new tab along the bottom of the configuration editor, enabling an
adapter will add a new category to the visual editor palette. Each
adapter category is labelled with a small icon that will also appear on
all graph figures from that adapter namespace.</p>

<h3 class="title" style="clear: both">Reading the Graph Figures</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each Spring Integration graph figure is composed of a bordered
icon, and represents some editable element of XML. Some figures will
have one or more gray boxes around their perimeter. Each box represents
a connection node, a reference to either an incoming connection from, or
an outgoing connection to another element. When the element backing the
graph figure has an ID, that ID will show appear as a label at the
bottom of the figure. Otherwise the figure will appear unlabelled.
Hovering over a figure brings forth a change of information. The label
that would normally indicate the ID of the element changes to show the
type of the element. If the figure has a connection node, an additional
label at the top of the figure will appear to identify the connection
node. When the figure has more than one connection node, this label will
change to identify the closest node. This is helpful for when making
connections to and from the figure.</p>
