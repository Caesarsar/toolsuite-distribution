<h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Visual Editing Enhancements</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The configuration editor provides visual editing capabilities for
Spring Batch and Spring Integration configuration files. Users can flip
to the batch-graph and integration-graph tabs to edit their
configurations via graphical interface, or simply to visualize their
configuration for presentations. Using the visual editor is as simple as
selecting a part from the palette on the left hand side, and dropping it
onto the canvas on the right. Connections can be drawn between parts by
selecting one of the connection tools, and then dragging between two
figures on the canvas. The mouse icon will change to indicate whether
the user is about to make a valid or invalid connection. The visual
editor has several enhancements:</p>
<p></p>

<h3 class="title" style="clear: both">Automatic & Manual Layouts</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The visual editor has two modes for laying out the graph. The
default is an automatic mode that attempts to layout the figures
optimally. While in this mode, figures can not be moved freely. Users
can toggle the layout button in the toolbar to turn on manual layout. In
manual layout figures can be moved and placed freely, and the layout
will be persisted when the configuration file is saved. The two layout
modes can be toggled at will; the visual editor will remember the
location of figures between modes.</p>

<h3 class="title" style="clear: both">Context Menus</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Right-clicking anywhere in the canvas portion of the visual
editor will bring up a context menu with actions relevant to the
selection. Basic actions such as undo and redo are supported. Depending
on the selection, users may also see an action for deleting a figure
from the graph. There are also two actions that provide alternate
editing options: The 'Reveal In Source File' action will switch the
configuration editor to the Source tab and highlight the XML for the
selected figure. The 'Show Properties' action will open the Properties
view and display the properties for the selection. Double clicking a
figure will also open the Properties view.</p>

<h3 class="title" style="clear: both">Properties Editing</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The configuration editor features an enhanced Properties view
that is designed for working alongside the visual editing tabs. The
Properties view is designed to track selections in the configuration
editor, and will update its contents based on the selection. New
form-based components display documentation for the selection and
property details as well as content-assist support for certain fields,
obviating the need to flip back and forth between form tabs and visual
editing tabs in the editor.</p>
