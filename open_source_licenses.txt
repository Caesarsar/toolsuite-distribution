Logback (LOGBACK)
The plug-in includes software developed by QOS.ch as part of the Logback project.
Though this package is dually licensed, Eclipse elects to use the package under the EPL.
LOGBACK including its source is available from 
http://logback.qos.ch/.

Logback License

As of release 0.9.18, logback source code and binaries are dual-licensed under the EPL v1.0 and the LGPL 2.1, or more formally:

Logback: the reliable, generic, fast and flexible logging framework. Copyright (C) 1999-2012, QOS.ch. All rights reserved. This program and the accompanying materials are dual-licensed under either the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 as published by the Eclipse Foundation or (per the licensee's choosing) under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.

The EPL/LGPL dual-license serves several purposes. The LGPL license ensures continuity in terms of licensing of the logback project. Prior to version 0.9.18, logback was licensed (exclusively) under the LGPL v2.1. Moreover, since the EPL is deemed incompatible by the Free Software Foundation, the LGPL will allow various licensees, in particular software distributors who may be already bound by the terms of the GPL or the LGPL, to distribute our software.

On the other hand, the EPL license will placate organizations which refuse certain restrictions imposed by the LGPL.

Please note that logback-classic is intended to be used behind the SLF4J API, which is licensed under the MIT license.

If you wish to make a significant contribution to the logback project, you are invited to file a Contributor License Agreement. The purpose of this agreement is to formalize the terms of your contribution and to protect the project in case of litigation.

Upon request, we may exempt open-source projects from LGPL and EPL's reciprocity clauses so that the said projects can develop logback extensions under the license of their choice. Exemptions are granted on a case by case basis.

   2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
   You changed the files; and

   3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
   distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from 
   the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to

   one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of 
   the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided 
   along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the 
   Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. 
   The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do 
   not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
   Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
   NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
   cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in 
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree 
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Cryptography

Export Control

The plug-in contains encryption software. The country in which you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession, and use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.

Encryption Items

Details of the encryption software in this plug-in are provided to assist in obtaining relevant export control classification and approval. Cryptography in this plug-in has been deemed eligible by the U.S. Government Department of Commerce for export under License Exception Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) for both object code and source code.
The plug-in contains a proprietary routine that encrypts and decrypts information used to login to Version Control Management (VCM) repositories. This routine uses the SHA-1 message digest algorithm implemented in a Java (TM) Runtime Environment (JRE), to generate a cryptographically secure sequence of bytes based on a user-supplied password combined with bytes supplied by a random number generator. The secure random numbers generated by this sequence are then added to each byte in the data to be encrypted. When the data is to be decrypted, the same password will generate the same sequence of random numbers, which is then subtracted from each byte in the encrypted data. Note that a JRE and therefore the aforementioned SHA-1 message digest code is not included with the plug-in.
The following Java classes contain encryption items (the plug-in may contain both binary and source code):
org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.auth.Cipher

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the 
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the 
best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public 
domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby

dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and 
to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends 
this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all

in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights 
includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) 
those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be 
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or 
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,

=============== APPENDIX. Standard License Files ============== 



--------------- SECTION 1: Eclipse Public License, V1.0 -----------

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

        i) changes to the Program, and

        ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or
        additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
        by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
        from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
        behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
        which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
        conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
        and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
    object code form.

    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
    if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
    shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
    if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
    addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
    by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
    other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
    se is licensed hereunder.

    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
    to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
    Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

    b) its license agreement:

        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
        warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
        for a particular purpose;

        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
        incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
        are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
        party; and

        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
        such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
        reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
        software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
    the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright
    notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement
, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect
to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter
any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If
You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references
to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and
"commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise
make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to   reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
    to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
     Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
     Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.
    If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.

      or a future version of this License issued under Section 6.1.
      For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which controls, is
      controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes
      of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or
      indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,

2. Source Code License.

   2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
      The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
      claims:

      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

      (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling
          of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and
          offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code
          (or portions thereof).

      (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
          Original Code under the terms of this License.

      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code;
          2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements
          caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

   2.2. Contributor Grant.

      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on
          an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
          of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or
          in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
          combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
          and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
          Version (or portions of such combination).

      (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective
          on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the
          Covered Code.

      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from
          the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor
          Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
          modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination
          of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
          (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices;
          or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
          absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

   3.1. Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
      are governed by the terms of this License, including without
      limitation Section 2.2.  The Source Code version of Covered Code
      may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
      version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
      include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
      You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
      Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
      this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
      may include an additional document offering the additional rights
      described in Section 3.5.

   3.2. Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
      be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
      License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
      you made an Executable version available; and if made available
      via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
      at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
      available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
      of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
      version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
      Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

   3.3. Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
      a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
      Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
      from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
      the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
      in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
      in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

   3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

      (a) Third Party Claims.

          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
          party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
          the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
          2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
          will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
          after the Modification is made available as described in Section
          3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
          copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
          other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
          newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
          the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

      (b) Contributor APIs.

          If Contributor's Modifications include an application
          programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent
          licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
          API, Contributor must also include this information in the
          LEGAL file.

      (c)   Representations.

          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
          by this License.

   3.5. Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
      Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
      include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
      where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You
      created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
      where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
      to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
      more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
      any Contributor.

      You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
      or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
      or liability terms You offer.

   3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
      of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously
      included in any notice in an Executable version, related
      documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
      rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
      Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
      of this License and that the license for the Executable version
      does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
      Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
      If You distribute the Executable version under a different license
      You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
      by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
      such terms You offer.

   3.7. Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
      code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
      the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
   of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
   in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with
   all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited
   by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
   detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

   6.1. New Versions.

      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish
      revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   6.2. Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
      the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
      that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
      Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
      terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

   6.3. Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
      you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
      Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
      license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",
      "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase
      do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
      differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
      Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
      Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in
      the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor
      in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
      deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE
   IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
   OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
   CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
   OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
   EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

   8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
      cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
      their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
      License shall survive.

   8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
      a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
      file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

      (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
          infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
          such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
          License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
          prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
          notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant
          a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
          future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
          withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
          Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice,
          a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
          agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
          is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
          under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
          expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

      (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
          Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
          patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant
          under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of
          the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
          Modifications made by that Participant.

   8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
      or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved
      (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
      patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
      licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
      shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
      any payment or license.

   8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all
      end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
      prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
   DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
   OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
   ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
   CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
   WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
   INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
   LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
   RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
   LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
   SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
   in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
   software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as
   such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
   with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
   (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with
   only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable.

   This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
   the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
   conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
   this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts
   of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa
   Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
   including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
   Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
   shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
   to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
   responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code
   as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial
   Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
   Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
   by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
